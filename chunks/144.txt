Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) and Mindfulness-Based Stress
Reduction (MBSR) are effective in reducing distress among people with physical or
mental health problems. However, implementation is limited by variable geographic
provision, ability to travel, and the need for remote service delivery during thecoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) crisis. Integration with Internet-enabled

that the number of sessions and their degree of guid-
ance moderates effect sizes ( Spijkerman et al.,
2016). Furthermore, fewer sessions limits opportu-

Improving access to MBIs is challenging, but
technologies like videoconferencing (VC) may
provide a convenient, cost-effective solution. Most
people have Internet access and use it daily ( Ofﬁce
for National Statistics, 2018 ), and there is a public
willingness to use video consultations with healthprofessionals ( NHS England, 2019 ). The cancella-

Reviews of individual interventions by VC attest
to its equivalence to in-person treatments: it is aseffective ( Backhaus et al., 2012 ;Chakrabarti,
2015;Drago, Winding, & Antypa, 2016 ), and the
therapeutic alliance is preserved ( Simpson & Reid,
2014). However, translating traditional 8-week

Aim and Review Questions
This review aimed to describe current evidence
about the feasibility, acceptability, safety, and ef ﬁ-
cacy of delivering MBCT/MBSR via group VC.
The review questions were:
1. How feasible and acceptable is delivering
group MBCT/MBSR-VC?
2. What technical considerations are neces-
sary to ensure safe delivery of MBCT/MBSR-VC?
3. How ef ﬁcacious is MBCT/MBSR-VC
compared with non-VC MBIs and other
control conditions (active and inactive)

Analytic Strategy
Data on populations, interventions, comparators,

tabulated, and narratively synthesized to draw con-
clusions about the similarities and differences
across studies. Where indices were unreported,
these were calculated where possible. Feasibility

was operationalized as the proportion of those
approached who responded, were eligible, con-sented, and who were study completers (provided a
complete dataset). Indices were calculated from the
whole sample where a study was controlled and
from the VC intervention where it was not. Accept-
ability was analyzed according to intervention
completer rate (participants completing at least
50% of the intervention) and patient satisfaction.
Safety indices
(participants completing at least
50% of the intervention) and patient satisfaction.
Safety indices were extracted using guidelines for
delivery of VC mental health services ( Luxton,

Feasibility results are presented in Table 3 .Zer-

They met their targets in all
indices except study completion (missed by 2%).
Only two studies reported suf ﬁcient data to be able
to calculate the majority of feasibility indices, mak-
ing inferences dif ﬁcult to draw. Differences in
study design and recruitment strategy led to large
variations in response rates (10 to 75%). Eligibility
rates followed a similar pattern, with recruitment
strategies designed to achieve a more representative
sample generally experiencing lower rates
designed to achieve a more representative
sample generally experiencing lower rates (e.g.,
Zernicke et al., 2014 : 37%) than those studies draw-
ing from a more selective, and arguably less repre-
sentative pool of participants (e.g., Krägeloh et al.,
2019: 99%). Consent rates varied from 17 to 93%,
although this variation is probably best explained
by differences in recruitment strategies and report-
ing. Finally, the rate of study completion (partici-

pants completing postintervention measures)ranged from 27 to 100%. Overall, however, study
completion rates were high, with only three studies
reporting rates below 75%.
Acceptability results are shown in Table 3 .
Intervention completion rates (participants
receiving at least half the intervention) could not
be calculated in four studies; the remaining six
ranged from 67 to 100%. Four studies included

ranged from 67 to 100%. Four studies included
formal participant satisfaction measures and
one reported informal participant comments.
Two studies reported participant satisfaction

75–100% remarking it was bene ﬁcial or met

and“Relating. ”Positive experiences included
attending from home and reduced travel. For
example, one participant said, “Ih a v eb e e ng l a d

MBSR, followed by adapted combined MBCT/MBSR, and the least common traditional MBCT.This is perhaps not surprising given MBSR wasoriginally developed to help people cope with ill-ness and pain. However, there is clear gap in the lit-
erature for VC delivery in mental health settings.
Reporting of adherence and treatment integritywas largely

set a priori benchmarks was Zernicke et al. (2014) .
Using their 85% study completion rate target as a

Perhaps surprisingly, in all ﬁve studies the facilita-

studies.

This mirrors the heterogeneity found in the litera-ture. Visted, Vøllestad, Nielsen, and Nielsen ’s

In summary, the evidence found in the present
study lends tentative support to the ef ﬁcacy of
delivering mindfulness by VC. There was no evi-dence of deterioration and there were promisingsigns that VC groups may prove not to be inferior to
traditional F2F MBCT/MBSR. Given that few
studies were randomized or of moderate or strongmethodological quality, our conclusions must betentative. Given the lack of common measures ofmindfulness or
quality, our conclusions must betentative. Given the lack of common measures ofmindfulness or self-compassion, no conclusionsabout proposed mechanisms of action can be

Strengths and Limitations
This is the ﬁrst review to focus on MBCT/
MBSR by VC. Although the limited and heteroge-
nous evidence base precluded meta-analysis, meth-
ods used for conducting this narrative synthesis
were rigorous. Following good practice recommen-
dations for systematic reviews ( Karlsson & Berg-
mark, 2015 )
Following good practice recommen-
dations for systematic reviews ( Karlsson & Berg-
mark, 2015 ) we separately extracted SMDs for the
WLC and active controls. We applied a robust, ﬂex-
ible quality appraisal tool ( Armijo-Olivo et al.,
2012) allowing appraisal of a range of quantitative
designs. However, this meant the strengths of the
qualitative analysis in Farver-Vestergaard et al. ’s
(2018) mixed methods study were not recognized
in the quality appraisal.
We were unable to aggregate data and

We were unable to aggregate data and instead
extracted individual study SMDs within a narrative
synthesis. Narrative synthesis, and vote counting
particularly have been criticized for lacking trans-
parency and introducing bias ( Valentine et al.,

of patterns across studies, vote-counting has

defenders ( Popay et al., 2006 ). In the present review
vote-counting was not used in isolation and conclu-
sions were triangulated with the extraction of
SMDs, which control for differing sample sizes. It
has been argued that narrative synthesis is a realistic
and useful method when limited evidence is avail-
able, provided the aims of the review are adjusted
and the claims made tentative ( Thomas et al.,
2017).

La terapia cognitiva basada en la atención plena (MBCT) y la reducción del estrés basada en la atención
