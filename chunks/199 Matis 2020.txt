Population Characteristics
The population characteristics of the included studies are
reported in Multimedia Appendix 2[74]. Most of the studies
examined mixed cancer types (n=11), mixed staged patients
(n=11), included patients after the completion of primary cancer
treatment (n=11), and were conducted in the United States
(n=15). Cancer stages ranged from 0 to 4. Note that if

recei ved hormonal therap y only, we considered them as having
completed primary cancer treatment.
Study Characteristics
The study characteristics of the included studies are reported in
Multimedia Appendix 2. A total of 2522 adults participated in
the study . Of the included studies, 10 were pre-post pilot

use of an accelerometer [84], and 1 study compared eMBP with
a parallel mindfulness program only [92]. Of the included
studies, 10 studies reported follow-up results, with the duration
from the postinterv ention assessment ranging from 4 weeks to
9
follow-up results, with the duration
from the postinterv ention assessment ranging from 4 weeks to
9 months. 
Inter vention Characteristics
The interv ention characteristics of the included studies are
reported in Multimedia Appendix 2. The primary delivery
platform, secondary interv ention delivery channel, and type of
reminder are summarized in Table 1. The primary platform is
an internet or internet-related technology that delivers eMBP .
The secondary interv ention delivery channel is the
internet-related technology that delivers eMBP .
The secondary interv ention delivery channel is the concrete
way in which the program is delivered to patients. The type of
reminder includes the ways in which the patients are reminded
of the program in an attempt to increase the patient’ s completion
rate and adherence to the interv ention. The most frequently used
primary platforms are websites (n=9) and smartphone apps
(n=8). All studies except one [71] used audio recordings as a
secondary
(n=9) and smartphone apps
(n=8). All studies except one [71] used audio recordings as a
secondary delivery mode (n=23), usually combined with other
channels. Reminders were used in almost half of the studies
(n=11), and almost half of them used email (n=5). Of all 24
studies, only 2 used the exact same combination of delivery
modes; these 2 studies were conducted by the same research
group [77,84]. These results reveal considerable heterogeneity
in the primary and secondary delivery modes of the

analysis [54,71,75,76,78,80,82,85,92], and 10 did not have a
comparison group (pre-post studies mentioned earlier). Of the
14 RCT studies, 2 were categorized as unclear regarding random
sequence allocation and allocation concealment [85,92] and 2
were categorized as unclear regarding the similarity of groups
at baseline or using an appropriate adjustment [87,89]. None of
the studies met the

the studies met the criteria for blinding of participants,
personnel, or outcome assessment, resulting in a high risk of
bias (note that because of the nature of the included studies, the
blinding of participants, personnel, and outcome assessment
was not possible).

review, we summarize the feasibility in terms of attrition and
adherence.
Attrition
All 24 included studies reported clear data for computing the
attrition rate. The attrition rate varied between 6% [79] and 46%

Predictors of Attrition
Regarding predictors of attrition, 9 studies reported the results
of their analysis [54,62,71,73,76,77,80,89,91,93]. Participants
who dropped out of the interv ention (or did not respond to

men [77]; had comorbidities and were less often occupied by

rather than an in-person program [62]. However, the authors of
2 studies did not find any differences between completers and
noncompleters [71,80]. In addition, the therapeutic alliance did
not predict treatment dropout [73].
Adherence
There is vast heterogeneity in adherence measures in the
reviewed studies. The studies have most often presented these
measures of
adherence measures in the
reviewed studies. The studies have most often presented these
measures of adherence as session completion (including session
attendance), practice frequenc y (eg, how often participants
meditated), and practice time (eg, time meditated). The summary
is presented in Multimedia Appendix 3.
Session Completion
Regarding the session completion of all 24 included studies,
only 14 studies could be assessed, 7 studies did not have
predef ined sessions [54,79,81,82,85,87,93],
14 studies could be assessed, 7 studies did not have
predef ined sessions [54,79,81,82,85,87,93], and 3 studies did
not report session completion data [75,88,94].
Of these 14 studies, 6 had comparable results. The other 8
studies [71,76,78,80,83,89,91,92] are limited in terms of this
comparison because of considerable heterogeneity in the type
of reported participants (enrollers, completers, and unclear) and
in the benchmark of minimum completed sessions (50%, 66%,
and 100%). In the 6 comparable
and
in the benchmark of minimum completed sessions (50%, 66%,

least half of the program was completed by 52% [86] to 83%
[90] of the enrolled participants (on average across these studies,
70%).
There is a consensus among some authors [8,62] that the
minimum adequate dose attendance of MBCT is 4 of 8 overall
sessions (half of the program). In this conte xt, based on the 6
comparable studies, eMBPs are on average feasible for 70%

Practice Frequency
Of all 24 included studies, 7 reported the practice frequenc y
[54,78,80,82,88,93,94]. In only 2 studies [87,94], it was possible
to derive the practice frequenc y adherence rate. In a study by
Kubo et al [87], 50% of completers were adherent for at least
50%, and in a study by Russel et al [94], 61% to 80% of
completers were 100% adherent. In the remaining 5
and in a study by Russel et al [94], 61% to 80% of
completers were 100% adherent. In the remaining 5 studies
[62,78,82,88,93], the adherence rate could not be calculated
because the minimum recommended time or the proportion of
participants who were adherent was not defined.
Practice Time
Of all 24 included studies, 7 reported the practice time

Predictors of Nonadher ence
Regarding predictors of nonadherence, 5 studies reported the
results of their analysis [76,77,82,84,91]. Participants who were

Attrition Rate
The attrition rate varied between 13% and 48% in the reviewed

52% [44]. The average

mindfulness-based interv entions ranges from 3% to 40% in
clinical and nonclinical populations [98] or below 25% in most
studies on adults with chronic medical diseases [99]. For
comparison, in meaning-centered group psychotherap y for
patients with advanced cancer in one study , 28.1% of patients
dropped out before the start of the group and 24.5% of

seems that the attrition rate of patients with cancer may be higher

the results by Compen et al [62], who documented that eHealth

If we use MBSR or MBCT programs as a gold standard in this
interv ention area, there is some consensus among experts,
supported by some experimental data, that 4-week mindfulness
programs seem to be efficacious for promoting well-being and
stress reduction, and this amount of completion can be
considered as a minimum adequate dose [8,62,102]. On average,
two-thirds of the enrolled participants in the reviewed studies
(52%-83%) completed at least half of the sessions. These

are similar to those from a review of web-based mindfulness

A relati vely small effect was observ ed in the conte xt of pain

patients with cancer [106] and that stress and pain reduction is
the primary goal of MBSR [107] and depression in MBCT

meta‐analysis of RCT studies by Cillessen et al [109] also
reported a small mindfulness effect on pain (Hedges granged
between 0.18 and 0.20). More generally , Warth et al [110]
reported a small effect of psychological interv ention (relaxation,

−0.05). For mindfulness-based interv entions, it was d=0.14. For
comparison with a less severe diagnosis such as migraine [111],
the effect size of MBSR on pain was medium to large (sensory
component 0.79 and affective component d=0.81). In the conte xt
of eMBP , Ljotsson et al [112] used internet-deli vered exposure

The effect size on pain was medium (d=0.64). The lower effect

progression over time in many patients in the program. In this

rumination, and neuroticism and a higher level of extraversion

follow-up after both interv entions. The program-induced
changes in mindfulness skills, fear of cancer recurrence, and
rumination during both interv entions predicted less
psychological distress at follow-up. As Cillessen et al [70]
discussed, most of these results are in
distress at follow-up. As Cillessen et al [70]
discussed, most of these results are in accordance with previous
research. For example, a study by Leng acher et al [125] found
that patients with more baseline severity had more severe

severity benef it relati vely more from MBPs than patients with

whom, with what kind of suffering, in what period of life and
disease, and at what readiness to change unhealth y behavior
and regulate emotions eMBP is the best tool. We have increasing
evidence that eMBPs are useful. However, it must be noted that
eMBPs are only one of many other tools in the repertoire of the
experienced clinician or clinical psychologist. The effect of
eMBP could be maximized when it is recommended to
clinician or clinical psychologist. The effect of
eMBP could be maximized when it is recommended to patients
suitable for this kind of interv ention and in the most effective
delivery mode. To answer these questions, we need to provide
eMBP to a large sample of patients in properly designed RCT
studies in which to manipulate various variables in different
study arms (eg, reminders, introductory lectures with the
facilitator , internet chat, web, app, or combinations, rewards,
