RESULTS
Search results
The initial search resulted in 195 articles, of which 38 were dupli -
cates. Initial screening resulted in 127 articles being excluded. Of 
the remaining 30 articles, only nine met eligibility criteria ( Figure 1). 
Full- text review demonstrated that three of the nine studies 
(Hommelson, 2022 ; Jakel et al., 2016 ; Villani et al., 2012) either did 
not report data or did not have a large enough sample size (≥30) 
to produce data suitable for statistical analysis (Gliner
not have a large enough sample size (≥30) 
to produce data suitable for statistical analysis (Gliner et al., 2017 ,

two studies had only one experimental group and no control 
group (Foley & Lanzillotta- Rangeley, 2021 ; Knill et al., 2021 ), two of 
the 11 criteria related to comparing the experimental group with the 
control group were not applicable.
Characteristics of selected studies
Six studies were selected for inclusion in this review (Foley & 
Lanzillotta- Rangeley, 2021 ; Hwang & Jo, 2019 ; Imamura et al., 2021 ; 
Knill et al., 2021 ; Sasaki et al., 2021 ; Villani et al., 2013 ). Three were 
RCTs,
et al., 2021 ; 
Knill et al., 2021 ; Sasaki et al., 2021 ; Villani et al., 2013 ). Three were 
RCTs, one was a secondary analysis of one of the selected RCTs, 
one was pre- experimental, and one was an evidence- based- practice 
quality improvement project ( Table 4). All participants were hospi -
tal clinical nurses, with sample sizes ranging from 30 to 949. Of the 
studies that reported gender and level of education, 86% of par -
ticipants were female, 23.2% had an associate degree or diploma,
level of education, 86% of par -
ticipants were female, 23.2% had an associate degree or diploma, 
70.8% had a bachelor's degree, and 6% had a graduate degree or 
were in a graduate degree program.
Findings
All six studies had significant findings using an alpha of 0.05 in their 
statistical analysis. One study showed improvement in well- being 
and burnout in nurses and NPs at 30, 60, and 90 days when the 
groups were pooled (Knill et al., 2021 ), and one showed improve -
ment in stress and
when the 
groups were pooled (Knill et al., 2021 ), and one showed improve -
ment in stress and self- efficacy within the experimental group at 
4 weeks (Hwang & Jo, 2019 ). However, both of these studies note 
that the participants had normal baseline scores of well- being, burn -
out (Knill et al., 2021 ), anxiety, and depression (Hwang & Jo, 2019 ) 
at the start of the study, potentially decreasing the effects of the in -
terventions. Imamura et al. (2021 ) showed a decrease in depression

the effects of the in -
terventions. Imamura et al. (2021 ) showed a decrease in depression 
at 3 months in the intervention group that used CBT modules in a 
fixed order over a 6- week period, but only for those whose baseline 
depression was ≤10 on the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale- 21, and 
these changes were not significant at 7 months. Sasaki et al. (2021 ) 
reported an increase in work engagement in the intervention group

that used a fixed order of CBT modules, but changes were not sig -
nificant at 7 months. Foley and Lanzillotta- Rangeley (2021 ) dem -
onstrated a decrease in depression, anxiety, and stress. Lastly, one 
study had improvement in anxiety and coping at 4 weeks (Villani 
et al., 2013 ).
Attrition was problematic for two of the six studies. Foley and 
Lanzillotta- Rangeley (2021 ) reported a completion rate of 40%. Knill 
et al. (2021 ) reported attrition in both groups,
(2021 ) reported a completion rate of 40%. Knill 
et al. (2021 ) reported attrition in both groups, resulting in a comple -
tion rate of 58% by the nurse group and 42% by the NP group.
A common feature of mHealth apps is the ability to analyze user 
engagement and ongoing use of the app by tracking the number 
of modules accessed, number of minutes a program is used, and 
how often the app is accessed (Fleming et al., 2018 ). Three of the 
studies in this review reported the mHealth app usage
(Fleming et al., 2018 ). Three of the 
studies in this review reported the mHealth app usage metrics in 
their studies. Foley and Lanzillotta- Rangeley (2021 ) showed that TABLE 3  JBI critical appraisal checklist tool for cohort studies.

the nurse anesthesia students completed an average of 6.5 ses -
sions out of the 10, averaging 51.2 min of meditation over the 10- 
day period. Knill et al. (2021 ) reported that the oncology nurses 
and NPs meditated for a combined 16,010 min; app usage by nurses 
dropped from 58% at day 30 to 39% at day 90, and NP app usage 
dropped from 72% at day 30 to 46% at day 90. The nurses
day 30 to 39% at day 90, and NP app usage 
dropped from 72% at day 30 to 46% at day 90. The nurses reported 
group use of the app while at work, so only one user was tracked, 
which made the individual usage rate appear lower. The most used 
program by all the participants combined was sleep hygiene (Knill 
et al., 2021 ). Imamura et al. (2021 ) and Sasaki et al. (2021 ) reported 
a module completion rate of >83% for all six modules of programs 
A and B, and a survey completion rate of >90% for
rate of >83% for all six modules of programs 
A and B, and a survey completion rate of >90% for programs A and 
B and the control group at 3 and 7 months. Villani et al. (2013 ) re-
ported 100% completion for all eight videos. Hwang and Jo (2019 ) 
did not report app usage history.
Primary interventions (aim 1)
Two studies used the mindfulness- based intervention (MBI) 
app, Headspace™ (Foley & Lanzillotta- Rangeley, 2021 ; Knill 
et al., 2021 ). Headspace™ was developed in 2012 by a Buddhist
Lanzillotta- Rangeley, 2021 ; Knill 
et al., 2021 ). Headspace™ was developed in 2012 by a Buddhist 
monk, Andy Puddicombe. Features of Headspace™ include guided 
meditations, breathing exercises, and psychoeducation to im -
prove stress and anxiety. Over 2100 businesses have partnered 
with Headspace™ to offer free access to their employees, and 
over 70 million people have downloaded the app (Headspace, n.d.; 
Curry, 2023 ). Headspace™ has been shown to reduce stress and in -

Curry, 2023 ). Headspace™ has been shown to reduce stress and in -
crease mindfulness and well- being in research studies (Economides 
et al., 2018 ; Flett et al., 2018 ; Howells et al., 2014 ). Headspace™ 
has a Mobile Application Rating Score of 4.6 out of 5, making it one 
of the best- rated apps available (Wang et al., 2021 ). Headspace™ 
offers a 10 day program at no charge (Headspace, n.d.). Hwang 
and Jo (2019 ) used an un- named proprietary stress- management

and Jo (2019 ) used an un- named proprietary stress- management 
app to deliver modules for meditation, breathing, yoga, healing 
music, physical fitness, and diet education. Imamura et al. (2021 ) 
and Sasaki et al. (2021 ) used a proprietary CBT app, ABC SM, to 
deliver educational modules in varying combinations on behavio -
ral activation, problem solving, CBT techniques, coping, assertive -
ness, job crafting, and self- compassion. Villani et al. (2013 )
CBT techniques, coping, assertive -
ness, job crafting, and self- compassion. Villani et al. (2013 ) used 
Mobile- stress inoculation therapy (SIT), using muscle relaxation 
exercises, autogenic training, and calming video scenes prior to 
delivering video with stress- inducing images.
Instrumentation, occupational, and mental health 
outcomes (aim 2)
Few studies used the same measurement tools to evaluate the ef -
fects of the mHealth app interventions ( Table 5). Occupational 
health outcomes
evaluate the ef -
fects of the mHealth app interventions ( Table 5). Occupational 
health outcomes included work engagement, perceived stress, job 
stress, emotional labor, and burnout. Mental health outcomes in -
cluded anxiety, depression, self- efficacy, well- being, and coping.Sustainability of outcomes (aim 3)
Of the six studies reviewed, four measured outcomes within 
the boundaries of the intervention length ( Table 4). Imamura 
et al. (2021 ) and Sasaki et al. (2021 ) were the only
the intervention length ( Table 4). Imamura 
et al. (2021 ) and Sasaki et al. (2021 ) were the only studies to evalu -
ate outcomes after the intervention ended, at 3 and 7 months. They 
demonstrated a decrease in depression and an increase in work en -
gagement, respectively, at 3 months, but no significant effect was 
observed at 7 months.

research showing that MBIs improve stress, depression, and anxiety

Regarding the length of mHealth app interventions in this re -

12 weeks. Two systematic reviews found that CBT- based mHealth

existing evidence limits solid predictive analytics (Hrynyschyn & 
Dockweiler, 2021 ; Lu et al., 2022 ).
SIT decreased anxiety and improved coping. There is a dearth 
of literature discussing the use of SIT to reduce anxiety in nurses; 
however, two studies have used SIT for nurses to decrease stress.

for mental health, Lecomte et al. (2020 ) found lasting benefits from

While the app usage rates in Knill et al. (2021 ) may appear low, 
they are higher than the range of usage rates of similar mHealth apps

reported that their high participation rate might have resulted from

Limitations
Strengths of the studies in this review are the RCT designs of four 
studies, a 7- month follow- up in two studies, app usage rates in two 
studies, and module completion rates in three studies. However, 
sample sizes in all but two of the studies were less than 60 at the 
study end, either
However, 
sample sizes in all but two of the studies were less than 60 at the 
study end, either by design or by attrition. Two studies reported 
that many participants' baseline measures were in the normal range, 
which would lessen the overall effects of the interventions. All the 
post- intervention measures were self- reported, which could intro -
duce response bias. Study duration did not extend beyond 12 weeks 
for any of the included studies and follow- up in all but two of the studies
extend beyond 12 weeks 
for any of the included studies and follow- up in all but two of the studies did not extend beyond the study period. Therefore, the sus -
tainability of the positive effects found with the mHealth app usage 
discussed in this review cannot be determined. Lastly, the studies 
used many different measures to evaluate outcomes, making pooled 
analysis of the data problematic.
There are some limitations in our review. We only included 
studies that measured effects of mHealth
are some limitations in our review. We only included 
studies that measured effects of mHealth apps on hospital nurses. 
This search restriction limits the ability to compare the effective -
ness of mHealth apps used in other healthcare professionals (e.g., 
physicians, pharmacists). However, we also recognize that hospi -
tal nurses may face different stressors and demands than other 
healthcare workers and may interact with mHealth app interven -
tions differently. Another limitation is that
workers and may interact with mHealth app interven -
tions differently. Another limitation is that we excluded studies 
that incorporated coaching, regular check- ins, or peer support as 
we were interested in the effectiveness of a self- guided mental 
health mHealth app that does not rely on other integrated inter -
ventions for success.
