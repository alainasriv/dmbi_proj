Search Outcome
The search resulted in 373 retrieved records from the data-
bases, of which 236 were duplicates. Following screening 
of titles and abstracts, 11 studies were assessed for eligi-
bility as full text, resulting in 4 studies being included in 
the review. Three studies were retrieved from the citation 
search, with 8 studies identified by hand searching and 6 
studies identified by grey literature, of which, 5 studies 
met the inclusion criteria. Accordingly, a total of 9

met the inclusion criteria. Accordingly, a total of 9 studies 
were included, as illustrated in Fig.  1.Methodological Quality of Included Studies
Both qualitative studies (Llaneza et al., 2022; Stjernsward 
& Hansson, 2020) had coherence between qualitative data 
sources, collection analysis, and interpretation with appro-
priate research questions for qualitative research followed

qualitative research followed 
by adequate data collection methods. Findings were also 
adequately derived from the data and results were suffi-
ciently interpreted from data. All 4 mixed-methods studies 
(Atreya et al., 2018 ; Dragomanovich et al., 2021; Lunsky 
et al., 2021; Stjernsward & Hansson, 2017) had issues with 
interpretation of integration of qualitative and quantitative 
components. One study had issues with qualitative interpre-

One study had issues with qualitative interpre-
tation of results, and a lack of consideration for confound-
ing factors (Dragomanovich et al., 2021). Another study 
had issues with sample selection, addressing divergences 
of quantitative and qualitative results, and the rationale for 
using a mixed-methods design (Stjernsward & Hansson, 
2017). The other study also had issues with the rationale 
for a mixed-methods design, integration of findings, and

Enablers of Online Mindfulness Practice
Three descriptive themes derived for enablers included (1) 
self-motivation, (2) positive experience of meditation, and 
(3) program structure and delivery.
Self‑motivation
Self-motivation can be defined as a complex psychologi-
cal process, involving how learners’ subjective beliefs and 
perceptions impact on their choices, effort, and
involving how learners’ subjective beliefs and 
perceptions impact on their choices, effort, and persistence 
in achieving their goals (Bakhtiar & Hadwin, 2022; Berliner 
& Calfee, 2004; Eccles & Wigfield, 2002). To provide bet-
ter support for the care recipient was noted as a motivator to 
participate in online MBI in 3 studies (Atreya et al., 2018 ; 
Dragomanovich et al., 2021 ; Stjernsward & Hansson, 2017).

their curiosity, whilst others participated to learn a new skill 
(Atreya et al., 2018; Dragomanovich et al., 2021). In one 
study, participants viewed mindfulness as a fashionable 
trend (Stjernsward & Hansson, 2020), thus prompting their

to participate in the intervention being driven, in part, by a 
desire to support in research in carer wellbeing (Atreya et 
al., 2018; Stjernsward & Hansson, 2017, 2020). Some par -
ticipants noted that participating in a research study with a 
deadline was a positive influence to continue with the inter -

adults with cognitive impairment reported that skills 
including breathing exercises, present moment awareness,

lives and thus encouraged adherence to online MBI pro-
grams (Llaneza et al., 2022). Some participants reported 
learning practical and meaningful skills from online MBI 
to empower them with better coping in the future (Lunsky et al., 2021). In addition, participants reported that having 
coping strategies available on their

coping strategies available on their personal mobile device 
was helpful as they were able to access support right after a 
stressful period or at a regular scheduled time (Llaneza et al., 
2022). In one study, participants experienced online MBI as 
a coping tool for stress, which in turn enhanced their wellbe-
ing (Stjernsward & Hansson, 2017). They noted that they

Participants also observed “thoughts come and go”, recog-

In the same study, participants reported reduced anxiety. This 
study was conducted to explore the value and usability of an

and somatic health problems.
Four out of nine study participants experienced improved 
sleep, enabling them to continue practices (Atreya et al., 2018;

2020; Stjernsward & Hansson, 2017, 2018, 2020). Some par -
ticipants recognised the training as an opportunity to look 
after their own needs, considering this as a valid excuse to 
take time off from caring (Stjernsward & Hansson, 2020). 
Further, participants valued to be connected with others in 
similar situations (Lunsky et al.,

(Lange, 2020 ; Llaneza et al., 2022 ; Lunsky et al., 2021 ; 
Stjernsward & Hansson, 2017, 2018, 2020; Zarei et al., 
2022). Interventions were available for the participants to 
access at their own convenience (Stjernsward & Hansson, 
2017). Participants noted that accessibility from home was 
especially beneficial when home bound with care recipients.

Participants from another study also noted that having the 
app in their personal device and being able to use it according 1269 Mindfulness (2024) 15:1257–1274 
to their personal schedule, mood, and time preferences were 
motivators of using the intervention (Llaneza et al., 2022). 
Support from the research team members was reported 
as an enabler in 2 studies (Stjernsward & Hansson, 2017, 
2020). Weekly email reminders

as an enabler in 2 studies (Stjernsward & Hansson, 2017,

researchers for enquiries and technical support were moti-
vators to continue the interventions (Stjernsward & Hans-

Barriers to Mindfulness Practices
Three descriptive themes derived for barriers included (1) 
lack of self-motivation, (2) external factors preventing par -
ticipation, and (3) program structure and delivery.
Lack of Self‑motivation
Lack of self-motivation was identified as a significant barrier 
to mindfulness practice in 6 studies (Lange, 2020; Llaneza 
et al., 2022; Lunsky et al., 2021;

et al., 2022; Lunsky et al., 2021; Stjernsward & Hansson, 
2017, 2018, 2020). Reasons for lack of motivation included 
low mood, inability to focus, lack of interest in using the app 
(Llaneza et al., 2022), procrastination (Lange, 2020; Stjern-
sward & Hansson, 2017, 2020), forgetfulness, difficulty in 
establishing new habits (Stjernsward & Hansson, 2017,

a stressor which hindered their participation (Lange, 2020; 
Stjernsward & Hansson, 2017, 2020). They reported being 
behind with the program schedule and struggling with daily 
chaos. Some participants reported MBI training as another

complete the training within the given schedule, which in 
turn generated stress for them (Stjernsward & Hansson, 
2020). Similarly, unmet expectations from the program also 
negatively influenced participation in the program (Stjern-
sward & Hansson, 2020).
External Factors Preventing Participation
All studies identified external factors as barriers to partici-
pation (Atreya et al., 2018; Dragomanovich et al., 2021; 
Lange, 2020; Llaneza et al., 2022; Lunsky
(Atreya et al., 2018; Dragomanovich et al., 2021; 
Lange, 2020; Llaneza et al., 2022; Lunsky et al., 2021; 
Stjernsward & Hansson, 2017, 2018, 2020; Zarei et al., 
2022). Life circumstances such as carers’ health issues 
(Dragomanovich et al., 2021; Lange, 2020) and advanced 
age were indicated as barriers to participation (Lange, 
2020). All studies identified time constraints as a barrier. 
These time constraints included health deterioration of the care recipient (Stjernsward & Hansson,
These time constraints included health deterioration of the care recipient (Stjernsward & Hansson, 2020), providing 
medical care (Dragomanovich et al., 2021), and support-
ing the daily activities including taking them to medical 
appointments (Lange, 2020; Llaneza et al., 2022). Train-
ing that generated negative feelings was another barrier to 
participation (Stjernsward & Hansson, 2017, 2018, 2020).

Program Structure and Delivery
Participants in 2 studies reported difficulty in under -
standing or following the program instructions

Some participants had trouble understanding exactly
al., 2018; Stjernsward & Hansson, 2020). 
Some participants had trouble understanding exactly 
what was expected of them, which induced a sense of 
insecurity as to whether they were doing the training 
properly and if they were gaining its benefits (Stjern-
sward & Hansson, 2020). Two carers (n = 20) from 
another study reported that they had trouble understand -
ing the instructions or content (Atreya et al., 2018 ). The 
study was conducted to assess feasibility, acceptabil-
ity, and
content (Atreya et al., 2018 ). The 
study was conducted to assess feasibility, acceptabil-
ity, and preliminary efficacy of an online MBI among 
patients with colorectal cancer and their informal car -
ers. Technology issues were identified as a barrier in 
4 studies (Atreya et al., 2018 ; Dragomanovich et al., 
2021; Lange, 2020; Stjernsward & Hansson, 2020). One 
participant experienced computer problems with web-
site issues and inaccessible content (Lange, 2020). This 
study investigated
problems with web-
site issues and inaccessible content (Lange, 2020). This 
study investigated the feasibility and acceptability of 
online MBI comprising of 15 informal carers of stroke 
survivors (Lange, 2020). Belonging to the control group 
also acted as a barrier in one study, meaning partici-
pants had to wait long periods for exposure to the online 
MBI (Stjernsward & Hansson, 2020).
Relationship of Enablers and Barriers

of Enablers and Barriers
Several concepts were identified for each of the enablers and 
barriers. These concepts were related to each other within 
and between the descriptive themes. Lack of self-motiva-
tion and external factors preventing participation can be 
interrelated due to their dependability with each other. For 
instance, care recipient illness may lead to procrastination in 
participating in online MBI. Program structure and delivery 
can positively or negatively be interrelated
in online MBI. Program structure and delivery 
can positively or negatively be interrelated with remaining 
enablers and barriers. A conceptual map related to this is 
presented in Fig.  2. 1270 Mindfulness (2024) 15:1257–1274
Discussion
This review has identified the potential enablers and bar -
riers to participating in an online MBI for informal carers. 
Though earlier reviews have synthesised evidence of some 
of these enablers and barriers among other populations 
(Guay et al., 2017;

(Guay et al., 2017; Linardon & Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, 2020; 
Marks et al., 2022; Winter et al., 2022), this review added 
to the existing knowledge by applying a systematic syn -
thesis of evidence of enablers and barriers in all studies of 
online MBI specific to the informal carer population. The 
review identifies that online delivery of MBI programs

This review identified self-motivation as an enabler for 
participating in online MBI. Similarly, previous studies 
have identified that carer motivation can be influenced 
by their perceptions, meanings and experiences, cul-
tural values, beliefs, spiritual beliefs, illness beliefs, and 
socialisation (Zarzycki et al., 2023). This review
beliefs, spiritual beliefs, illness beliefs, and 
socialisation (Zarzycki et al., 2023). This review revealed 
that previous positive experiences of mindfulness were 
a key enabler for participation in online MBI programs 
(Atreya et al., 2018; Lange, 2020; Stjernsward & Hansson, 
2017, 2020). This finding is in keeping with a previous 
study conducted by Guay et al. ( 2017 ), which reported 
interventions tailored for behavioural change can have a

In contrast, identified barriers related to lack of self-
motivation for participating in an online MBI have also 
been well documented in previous studies. Issues such 
as individual characteristics, viewing the program as a 
stressor, and unmet expectations of the program were dis-
cussed. Some of these findings have been reported in a 
previous systematic review which investigated
Some of these findings have been reported in a 
previous systematic review which investigated the engage-
ment strategies to improve participant adherence and 
retention in online mindfulness programs. It was identified 
that participants with poorer psychological wellbeing were 
more likely to drop out and disengage with interventions 
(Winter et al., 2022). Another study also identified that 
rumination and worry can hinder the participant retention 
rate in online MBI (Banerjee et al.,
rumination and worry can hinder the participant retention 
rate in online MBI (Banerjee et al., 2018).
Aligning with our findings, difficulty understanding 
the program structure has been reported as a barrier in a 
previous study of online MBI for cancer patients (Com-
pen et al., 2017). Saleem et al. (2021), in their study of 
understanding engagement strategies in online interven-
tions, suggested some mitigation strategies such as send-
ing reminders to participants, including colourful
some mitigation strategies such as send-
ing reminders to participants, including colourful pictures, 
visual content, large colourful icons, and easy-to-under -
stand content. Similarly, the broader literature has also identified negative effects of the training as a barrier for 
MBI support (Britton et al., 2021; Taylor et al., 2022). 
A systematic review was conducted to identify adverse 
effects of meditation interventions and mind-body prac-
tices, including 61 studies divided commonly
of meditation interventions and mind-body prac-
tices, including 61 studies divided commonly reported 
negative effects from meditation interventions into 2 cat-
egories: mental distress and somatic distress (Taylor et al., 
2022). Britton et al. (2021) have shown that MBI prac-
tices can be associated with transient distress and nega-
tive impacts on participants, with mild to severe levels of 
depression and persistently high levels of negative affect. 
Therefore, it is recommended that

Therefore, it is recommended that facilitators are aware of 
this risk and identify potential areas that require monitor -
ing and intervention to maximise the safety and efficacy 
of MBI (Britton et al., 2021). Thus, creation of a strate -
gic approach and clear protocols for distress management 
align with goals that are essential to safe interaction of 
participants with online MBI (Taylor et al., 2022).
This review has

participants with online MBI (Taylor et al., 2022).
This review has identified the relationship between pro-
gram structure and delivery and external factors preventing 
participation (Fig.  2). Similar to our findings, previous stud-
ies have also identified competing priorities, programs not 
meeting participant needs, and lack of technical skills, time, 
and motivation (Boele et al., 2018; Moscato et al., 2019; Piil 
et al., 2015; van der Linden et al., 2018) as
(Boele et al., 2018; Moscato et al., 2019; Piil 
et al., 2015; van der Linden et al., 2018) as barriers to online 
MBI. It is also important to recognise here the relationship 
of sample characteristics for participating in web-based 
interventions including socio-economic background, educa -
tion, and perceived health, as they can impact the adherence 
(Wu et al., 2022).

porated advisory committee input for developing online 
interventions (Atreya et al., 2018; Dragomanovich et al., 
2021). Co-design of internet-based interventions is known 
to be complex, as it involves interaction between research-
ers, users, and software developers (Thabrew et al.,
as it involves interaction between research-
ers, users, and software developers (Thabrew et al., 2018). 
However, this is a good strategy to employ when developing 
online MBI within the informal carer population. Carer peer 
groups can also be involved with online MBI development, 
as carers are more likely to connect with other carers to share 
their experiences and knowledge (Schirmer et al., 2022 ).

Solutions created for informal carers need to be internally

fore, involving informal carers in the development process of 
online MBI may increase commitment to complete activities 
as they know what works best and what to include as they 
have lived experience of being a carer. Incorporating stake-
holders to introduce online MBI and active governmental

meet the needs of informal carers, supporting access, and 
enabling their participation.

rates of participants. One such framework is the Theoreti-
cal Domain Framework (TDF) (Michie et al., 2005), which 
explores implementation problems, and seek to better under -
stand behaviour-change processes in the application of 
evidence-based care (Francis et al., 2012). This framework 
is comprised of 12 key constructs relevant to changing the 
behaviour of consumers (Michie et al., 2005). The TDF has

concept map in this study. Hence, the current review has so 
far identified only two aspects of the TDF. This acknowl-

Limitation and Future Research
There are some limitations to this review. We acknowledge 
that there were limitations of the terms used; however, we
