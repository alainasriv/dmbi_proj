Digital  mindfulness-based  interventions  (d-MBIs)  present  a
promising  path  for  the  scalable  dissemination  of  mindfulness
instruction  in  the  21st  century.  Smartphone  applications  and
web-based  platforms  can  offer  potential  advantages  over
traditional  face-to-face  formats  through  enhanced
accessibility,  standardization,  personalization,  and  efﬁcacy  of
mindfulness  training.  A  growing  body  of  research  has
documented  that  a  digital  approach  to  teaching  mindfulness
can  improve  measures  of  attention,  stress,  depression,  and
anxiety.  However,  effective  digital  mindfulness  instruction  must
overcome  a  variety  of  challenges,  including  the  possibility  of
low  engagement,  shallow  learning,  and  unaddressed  obstacles
or  frustrations.  Fortunately,  best  practices  from  multiple  ﬁelds
of  research  provide  strategies  to  overcome  these  challenges.

Since  mindfulness  apps  began  circulating  in  2007,  digital
mindfulness  training  has  reached  millions  of  people  all
over  the  world  [1,2].  There  are  now  thousands  of
mindfulnessapps  on  the  market,  and  these  apps  attracted
more  than  $150  million  of  venture  capital  in  2017  alone
[1,3].  Traditional  face-to-face  programs  like  Mindfulness-
Based  Stress  Reduction  are  also  being  turned  into
e-courses,  while  digital  mindfulness  teacher  training
programs  are  growing  in  popularity  as  well  [4,5].  Thismeteoric  rise  of  digital  mindfulness-based  interventions
(d-MBIs)  presents  an  unprecedented  opportunity  to
deliver  high-quality  training  to  an  increasingly  internet-
connected  global  audience.  Here  we  review  the  promise,
existing  research,  challenges,  and  best  practices  for  this
new  era  of  mindfulness  training.
Promise
There  are  several  potential  advantages  to  a  digital
approach  to  mindfulness  training,  including  enhanced
accessibility,  standardization,  personalization,  and
efﬁcacy.
Accessibility
A  key  beneﬁt  of  d-MBIs  is  that  they  can  reduce
geographical,  logistical,  and  ﬁnancial  constraints  that
would  otherwise  prevent  access  to  high  quality  training
[6,7].  Users  also  report  enjoying  the  greater  accessibility
and  scheduling  ﬂexibility  of  digital  training  [6,8].  In  one
study,  users  of  a  d-MBI  reported  that  the  training’s
accessibility  facilitated  their  engagement  by  allowing
them  to  access  it  across  devices  and  at  the  times  of  their
choosing  [9/C15].
Standardization
Even  a  great  curriculum  can  fail  to  provide  beneﬁts  if  it  is
delivered  ineffectively.  Digital  training  provides  the
opportunity  to  standardize  key  elements  of  course  con-
tent  and  presentation,  thereby  ensuring  that  all  users
receive  the  same  high-quality  instruction  [10,11].
Personalized  learning
Digital  training  can  also  provide  content  that  is  tailored  to
the  abilities,  interests,  and  values  of  individual  users.  For
example,  d-MBIs  can  provide  users  with  immediate
personalized  feedback,  which  is  challenging  to  achieve
in  traditional  classrooms  with  many  students  [10,12].
Overall,  a  personalized  approach  that  tailors  the  curricu-
lum  to  individual  students  has  been  shown  to  heighten
both  engagement  and  learning  outcomes  [12,13].
Efﬁcacy
Although  one  might  assume  that  in-person  instruction
would  produce  superior  learning  outcomes,  research
$The  writing  of  this  article  was  supported  by  the  U.S.  Department  of  Education’s  Institute  of  Education  Sciences  (grant  number  R305A170445).Available  online  at  www.sciencedirect.com
ScienceDirect
www.sciencedirect.com  Current  Opinion  in  Psychology  2019,  28:81–86 suggests  that  well-designed  digital  training  can  elicit
equal  or  even  greater  outcomes  [8,12,14].  For  instance,
one  comparative  study  found  that  both  d-MBI’s  and  face-
to-face  mindfulness  interventions  were  equally  effective
in  helping  reduce  perceived  levels  of  depression,  anxiety,
and  stress  [15].
Existing  research
A  large  and  growing  body  of  research  suggests  that  face-
to-face  mindfulness  interventions  can  lead  to  a  myriad  of
beneﬁts  [16].  Can  strictly  digital  MBIs  that  lack  face-to-
face  interaction  deliver  beneﬁts  as  well?  Although  much
less  research  exists,  here  we  provide  a  brief  review  of
recent  research  into  the  effects  of  d-MBIs  on  three
categories  of  outcomes:  ﬁrst,  mindfulness  and  attention,
second,  stress,  and  third,  depression  and  anxiety.
Mindfulness
Stjernsward  &  Hansson  [17]  administered  a  d-MBI  to
97  individuals  experiencing  distress  due  to  a  mental
illness  in  their  family.  The  eight-week  course  was
adapted  from  the  standard  MBSR  training  protocol  and
included  a  total  of  960  minutes  of  mindfulness  practice.
Completion  of  the  intervention  was  associated  with  a
signiﬁcant  increase  at  post-test  and  3-month  follow  up
in  the  Acting  with  Awareness  subscale  of  the  Five  Facet
Mindfulness  Questionnaire  (FFMQ;  e.g.  “I  ﬁnd  myself
doing  things  without  paying  attention” ;  reverse  coded).
Shore  et  al.  [18/C15]  delivered  a  much  less  intensive  d-MBI  to
110  university  students.  After  completing  just  an  hour-
long  introduction  to  mindfulness,  participants  reported
improvements  on  the  Acting  with  Awareness  subscale  of
the  FFMQ  at  post-test  and  1-week  follow  up  assess-
ments.  Noone  and  Hogan  [19]  reported  a  similar  increase
in  their  participants’  scores  on  the  FFMQ  following  a
brief  d-MBI.
Kemper  [20]  also  investigated  the  effects  of  a  one-hour  d-
MBI  among  health  professionals.  Completion  of  the
module  was  associated  with  signiﬁcant  improvements
on  the  Mindfulness  Attention  Awareness  Scale  (MAAS).
Participants  who  engaged  in  a  four-week  d-MBI  using  the
mobile  phone  application  Headspace  reported  similar
improvements  on  the  MAAS  [21].
Stress
A  comprehensive  meta-analysis  by  Jayawardene  and  col-
leagues  [22/C15/C15]  considered  eight  separate  randomized  con-
trolled  trials  that  measured  the  effects  of  digital  mindful-
ness  interventions  on  stress.  The  digital  interventions
were  all  administered  online,  and  most  were  adapted
from  the  MBSR  protocol  [23],  although  they  varied  in
duration  from  two  to  twelve  weeks.  Meta-analysis  of  the
eight  studies  found  a  signiﬁcant  medium  effect  size  for
the  mindfulness  interventions  on  perceived  stress.Further  research  utilizing  a  variety  of  d-MBIs  and  partic-
ipant  populations  has  provided  additional  support  for  the
efﬁcacy  of  d-MBIs  in  reducing  stress  [24–28 ].  However,
failures  to  replicate  this  stress  effect  have  occurred
[29,30].
Depression  &  anxiety
Boettcher  et  al.  [31]  analyzed  the  effect  of  an  eight-week
d-MBI  on  reducing  depression  and  anxiety  among  a
sample  of  participants  diagnosed  with  an  anxiety  disorder.
The  d-MBI  decreased  both  depressive  symptoms  and
anxiety.  Similarly,  Querstret  et  al.  [32]  found  that  a  four-
week  d-MBI  that  consisted  of  lessons  and  guided  medita-
tions  also  reduced  depressive  symptoms  and  anxiety  in  a
community  sample.  Krusche  et  al.  [33]  utilized  the  same
course  as  Querstret  et  al.  [32],  and  reported  similar  reduc-
tions  in  depression  for  those  participants  who  completed
the  course.  Finally,  additional  studies  found  a  two-week
d-MBI  to  signiﬁcantly  decrease  anxiety  and  depression  in
university  staff  and  students  [18/C15,34].
Across  these  categories  of  outcomes,  this  review  suggests
that  d-MBIs  may  be  a  promising  approach  for  delivering
mindfulness  training;  however,  this  work  has  limitations
due  to  the  nascence  of  d-MBIs.  For  example,  a  quarter  of
the  studies  described  did  not  include  a  control  condition.
Additionally,  completion  rates  were  often  quite  low.
Across  the  studies  described,  the  average  attrition  rate
was  34.5%.  Even  with  participants  who  technically  com-
pleted  the  intervention,  44%  of  the  studies  we  reviewed
mentioned  problems  with  adherence;  participants  were
not  fully  engaging  in  the  lessons  and  activities  as
prescribed.  These  challenges,  amongst  others,  are
necessary  to  acknowledge  and  address  as  d-MBIs  become
increasingly  commonplace.
Challenges
While  d-MBIs  have  many  potential  advantages,  they  also
face  numerous  challenges.  A  review  of  the  literature
reveals  at  least  six  categories  of  challenges  that  many
d-MBIs  must  strive  to  overcome,  most  of  which  are
challenges  for  in-person  training  programs  as  well.
Selecting  an  audience
No  two  audiences  are  the  same.  Middle  school  students
and  military  veterans,  for  instance,  have  dramatically
different  needs,  interests,  and  capabilities.  d-MBIs  must
be  sensitive  to  the  distinguishing  characteristics  of  their
chosen  target  audience.  For  example,  d-MBIs  that
include  a  spiritual  dimension  risk  having  users  with  strong
religious  afﬁliations  feel  that  mindfulness  is  inconsistent
with  their  religious  beliefs  [35].
Selecting  objectives
A  d-MBI  lacking  clear  objectives  may  fail  to  reach  its  full
potential  impact  on  valued  outcome  measures.  This  is
because  different  approaches  to  teaching  mindfulness82  Mindfulness
Current  Opinion  in  Psychology  2019,  28:81–86  www.sciencedirect.com may  be  best  suited  for  achieving-speciﬁc  outcomes.  For
example,  Querstret  et  al.  [36/C15]  observed  that  although  a
d-MBI  improved  three  facets  of  mindfulness,  only  one
facet,  Acting  with  Awareness,  mediated  the  effects  of  the
d-MBI  on  key  outcome  measures  of  work-related  rumi-
nation,  fatigue,  and  sleep  quality.  One  resulting  hypoth-
esis  is  that  a  d-MBI  designed  at  the  outset  to  improve  a
speciﬁc  outcome  may  be  most  effective  if  instructional
emphasis  is  placed  on  the  facets  of  mindfulness  most
likely  to  mediate  that  outcome.
Audience  diversity
It  is  also  important  for  d-MBIs  to  address  individual
differences  within  their  target  audience.  For  example,
a  portion  of  users  will  possess  a  ﬁxed  mindset  about  their
ability  to  be  mindful,  believing  that  this  capacity  is
immutable.  This,  in  turn,  can  lead  to  decreased  effort
[37,38].  Individuals  with  a  ﬁxed  mindset  would  therefore
beneﬁt  from  tailored  instruction  that  would  promote  a
growth  mindset.
Maintaining  engagement
As  described  brieﬂy  above,  users  of  many  d-MBIs  have
problematically  low  adherence.  Several  studies  assessing
d-MBIs  report  high  participant  drop-out,  with  one  review
paper  reporting  attrition  rates  ranging  from  7.7%  to  52.3%
[39].  Furthermore,  some  participants  report  having  difﬁ-
culty  staying  engaged  with  d-MBI  exercises.  Instead,
users  sometimes  end  up  using  the  meditation  practices
as  a  time  to  intentionally  engage  in  ruminative  thinking
and  to  create  a  mental  to-do  list  [40/C15].
Effective  learning
Effective  learning  includes  not  only  the  retention  of
factual  knowledge,  but  also  a  conceptual  understanding
that  allows  for  the  ﬂexible  use,  transfer,  and  application  of
knowledge  across  contexts  [41].  Achieving  effective
learning  is  a  challenge  in  any  context,  and  this  is  certainly
true  for  d-MBIs.  Participants  of  MBIs  have  reported
struggling  to  grasp  the  core  concepts  of  mindfulness,
expressed  uncertainty  that  they’re  practicing  correctly,
or  misinterpreted  the  purpose  of  the  intervention  entirely
[40/C15,42].
Troubleshooting
It  is  inevitable  that  individuals  will  encounter  obstacles
and  frustration  when  training  in  mindfulness.  Users  of  d-
MBIs  have  reported  experiencing  negative  thoughts  and
anxious  feelings  during  meditations  [9/C15,40/C15],  as  well  as  a
desire  to  discuss  these  emerging  thoughts  and  feelings
with  an  instructor  or  peers  [9/C15].  Other  challenges  that  arise
are  discomfort,  difﬁculty  sustaining  focus,  feeling  self-
critical,  and  doubts  that  mindfulness  is  helpful  [40/C15].
Leaving  these  challenges  unaddressed  leads  to  decreased
engagement  [9/C15,40/C15,43].Best  practices
Although  d-MBIs  face  numerous  challenges,  these  issues
can  be  mitigated  by  creatively  applying  the  best  practices
in  digital  learning.
Deﬁning  and  understanding  your  audience
If  program  creators  are  to  build  optimally  effective  d-
MBIs,  they  must  ﬁrst  select  and  understand  their  audi-
ence.  Deﬁning-speciﬁc  target  audience  demographics
early  on  paves  the  way  for  user  research.  Conducting  user
research  on  target  audience  behaviors,  needs,  and  moti-
vations  can  inform  the  design  and  content  of  a  d-MBI.
User  research  methodologies  can  include  surveys,  focus
groups,  persona  development,  and  individual  interviews,
among  others  [44].
Selecting  learning  objectives  and  target  outcomes
After  deﬁning  and  understanding  a  target  audience,  pro-
gram  creators  can  make  an  informed  decision  when
selecting  learning  objectives  and  training  outcomes  that
are  most  relevant  to  their  audience.  For  example,  if  the
target  audience  has  a  clinical  diagnosis  of  ADHD,  learn-
ing  objectives  might  consist  of  cultivating  a  growth  mindset
about  attention  and  a  target  outcome  might  be  improving
sustained  attention.  Selected  learning  objectives  and  target
outcomes  can  then  inform  the  design  of  program  content
to  increase  the  d-MBI’s  relevance  and  efﬁcacy  [45].
Addressing  audience  diversity
Members  of  a  speciﬁc  target  audience  often  share  certain
characteristics,  but  heterogeneity  will  undoubtedly  exist.
Personalization  of  program  content  can  facilitate  individ-
ual  engagement  and  improve  learning  outcomes  by  align-
ing  a  user’s  experience  with  their  existing  knowledge,
interests,  and  goals  [46,47,48/C15].
Maintaining  engagement
Sustained  engagement  throughout  the  entirety  of  a  d-
MBI  is  essential.  This  can  be  achieved  through  person-
alization  [12,13],  chunking  content  into  short  segments
[49],  enhancing  intrinsic  motivation  by  designing  content
that  is  truly  interesting  [48/C15],  and  embedding  frequent
constructive  learning  exercises  that  help  users  engage
with  content  [50].
Effective  learning
A  number  of  best  practices  exist  for  enhancing  the  effec-
tiveness  of  digital  instruction  [49].  For  example,  materials
should  be  broken  into  segments  and  reviewed  regularly
[51].  It  is  also  well-established  that  including  graphics  and
visuals  signiﬁcantly  improves  learning  [52].  Digital
instruction  is  also  enhanced  when  extraneous  words,
graphics,  and  sounds  are  omitted  [53].  Working  memory
capacity  is  limited,  so  presentational  clutter  can  prevent
processing  of  key  concepts  [49].Digital  mindfulness-based  interventions  Mrazek  et  al.  83
www.sciencedirect.com  Current  Opinion  in  Psychology  2019,  28:81–86 Troubleshooting
d-MBIs  possess  the  capability  to  proactively  address
challenges  that  may  be  faced  by  users.  Anticipating
common  challenges  early  on,  identifying  challenges  as
they  arise,  and  offering  support  in  an  efﬁcient  and  acces-
sible  manner  can  mitigate  many  issues  that  occur  [54,55].
For  example,  when  a  challenge  is  identiﬁed,  users  can  be
directed  to  a  support  page  that  provides  responses  to  a  list
of  common  challenges  experienced.  Moreover,  discussion
forums  can  connect  users,  providing  a  community  of
individuals  who  may  be  willing  to  listen,  offer  support,
and  share  their  own  challenges.  If  possible,  trained  staff
and  counselors  can  provide  emotional  support  when
necessary  [56].
Conclusion
Given  the  widespread  use  of  mindfulness  apps  and  digital
courses,  d-MBIs  are  rapidly  becoming  the  predominant
way  that  people  around  the  world  are  introduced  to
mindfulness.  This  understandably  gives  some  people
pause,  as  the  direct  transmission  of  mindfulness  training
from  instructor  to  student  has  been  the  norm  until
recently.  As  noted,  although  this  distribution  method  is
promising,  there  are  challenges  to  a  digital  approach.  The
list  of  challenges  described  presently  is  not  a  complete
account,  and  additional  obstacles  such  as  community
building  and  embodiment  are  important  for  d-BMIs  to
address.
Despite  these  challenges,  there  is  now  evidence  that  the
intersection  of  mindfulness  and  technology  is  already
producing  d-MBIs  capable  of  eliciting  meaningful
beneﬁts.  Arguably,  the  rapidly  unfolding  digital  revolu-
tion  could  succeed  not  only  in  improving  the  accessibility
of  mindfulness  training,  but  also  in  increasing  its  efﬁcacy.
If  the  design  of  d-MBIs  is  guided  by  emerging  literature
on  best  practices  and  combined  with  an  empirical
approach  of  constant  iteration  and  improvement,  the
highest  quality  mindfulness  training  may  eventually  be
accessible  to  anyone  with  an  internet-connected  device.
Then  wherever  you  go,  there  it  is.

This  comprehensive  meta-analysis  of  eight  separate  randomized  con-
trolled  trials  found  a  signiﬁcant,  medium  effect  size  for  d-MBIs  on
perceived  stress.  The  digital  interventions  were  all  administered  online,
and  most  were  adapted  from  the  MBSR  protocol,  although  they  varied  in
duration  from  two  to  twelve  weeks.

Banerjee,  Cavanagh  &  Strauss  interviewed  16  healthcare  staff  members
who  participated  in  a  mindfulness-based  self-help  intervention.  “Attitude
towards  engagement”,  “intervention  characteristics”,  “process  of
change”  and  “perceived  consequences”  were  identiﬁed  as  four  over-
arching  themes  that  characterized  facilitation  and  hinderance  to  engage-
ment  in  the  intervention.  Key  facilitators  to  engagement  reported  by  the
sample  included  shorter  practices,  motivation  to  reduce  stress,  and  an
increased  feeling  of  control  over  thoughts.

Enhancing  interest  is  a  priority  for  educators  if  students  are  to  most  effectively
attend  and  engage  with  their  academics.  Situational  interest  evoked  by
feelings  of  enjoyment  and  excitement  toward  a  topic  can  transform  over  time
into  durable  individual  interest  in  particular  subjects.  The  incorporation  of
attention-grabbing  structural  features,  context  personalization,  problem-
based  learning,  and  utility-value  interventions  can  be  used  to  develop  interest.
