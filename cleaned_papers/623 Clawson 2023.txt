DEDICATION  
My journey in mindfulness began when it was introduced to me by my high school English 
teacher, Mr. Lucas. The impact of this was profound as it helped me better appreciate life and 
was the beginning of a long journey in which I incorporated mindfulness both into my personal life and clinical work. Sadly, he passed away from cancer during my senior year before I was able to tell him about the impact it had on me; however, the lessons he taught me have continued to guide me since. This review is in honor of him.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  
I would like to extend my thanks to my previous chairperson Dr. Drew Erhardt who 
helped guide me through my preliminary exam before he had to take medical leave. Dr. Erhardt 
interviewed me when I applied to Pepperdine University and has be en a role model for me ever 
since. Moreover, I have been incredibly lucky to have found my chairperson Dr. Adel Najdowski who was incredibly helpful and supportive as I adapted to the many changes that have occurred since 2020. Special thanks to my committ ee member Dr. Francesca Parker for 
the many zoom meetings we had despite the different time zones and for your support from the beginning in conducting this review. I also would like to thank my research assistant Francis Migues (“Blake” as he prefers to b e called) for the outstanding work he has done and for his 
dedication throughout the data collection process. Furthermore, I would like to thank the many classmates and professors whom I consulted with during this process as their source of overwhelming ki ndness and collaboration continues to inspire me. I consider myself very lucky 
for having parents who have been supportive since the beginning regarding my career path in 
psychology and who have above all inspired me to work hard to achieve my dreams. Most  of 
all, I could not have done this without the love and support of my fiancé e Jaimie Porras, as I 
cannot express enough my gratitude for having her come into my life.

ABSTRACT  
 
Mindfulness is now utilized throughout Western Society and is part of the growing behavioral 
health, self -help, and wellness movements. Mobile applications have become increasingly 
popular for a wide variety of uses related to physical health, mental health, and self -
improvement. Therefore, mindfulness -based mobile applications have promise both as stand-
alone tools for end- users seeking self -help resources and as clinician -recommended adjunctive 
tools to enhance the process and outcomes of professional therapy. This systematic review identified, reviewed, and synthesized the findings from studies ( n = 29) concerning the impact 
of mindfulness -based mobile applications on specific aspects of psychological functioning in 
both the general population and clinical samples. The aim was to clarify the conclusions warranted based on the extant literature regarding the benefits, limitation s, and future directions 
of mindfulness -based mobile applications with respect to enhancing well -being and reducing 
depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and stress among clinical and general population adults. English- language studies published between 2009 and 2021 that examined iOS and/or 
Android compatible mindfulness -based mobile applications were included in the review. The 
results indicated that mindfulness -based mobile applications are effective in reducing 
symptoms of anxiety, depression, and stre ss (both perceived and physiological), in addition to 
improving well- being. Areas for future research are discussed.  
Keywords: anxiety, depression, mindfulness, mobile apps, stress, well -being 1 
 
Chapter 1: Background and Rationale  
Statement of the Problem 
Symptoms of anxiety and depression are common in the general population, with 
anxiety disorders being the most common mental health disorders worldwide, depression 
being the leading cause of disability globally (World Hea lth Organization [WHO], 2021), and 
the comorbidity rate of Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety Disorders being 60% in the United States (Calkins et al., 2015). Symptoms of anxiety and depression represent a significant public health concern, as they are associated with distress and can increase one’s risk for developing diagnosable anxiety and mood disorders (Laeger et al., 2012). Anxious and depressive symptoms may also contribute to or exacerbate physiological conditions, such as cardiovascular disease (Bomhof -Roordink et al., 2015) and insomnia (Jansson- Fröjmark & 
Lindblom, 2008). Furthermore, anxiety disorders have been found to be more common in western cultures (Baxter et al., 2013) resulting in an economic burden of 63.1 billion dollars in the Unit ed States in 1998 due primarily to medical expenses such as primary care visits 
(Greenberg et al., 1999). A comorbid diagnosis of depression and anxiety has also been found to be more costly to treat in comparison to those only suffering from an anxiety di sorder 
(Marciniak et al., 2005). Both anxious and depressive symptoms can affect cognitive functioning. For example, Ng et al. (2012) found that higher levels of depressive symptoms were associated with decreased efficiency when completing a cognitive task . Additionally, 
anxiety symptoms were associated with increased reaction times, resulting in slower completion of the cognitive task.  
Unfortunately, various factors can exacerbate mental illness, with stress being a 
notable example. Hirsch et al. (2019) f ound that higher perceived stress among college 
students was associated with greater risk for depressive symptoms and, consequently, an increased risk for suicide. Although everyone experiences stress from time to time, high  2 
 
levels of stress have been foun d to worsen mental illness. For instance, Toussaint et al. (2016) 
used an online stress assessment system to measure 96 types of acute and chronic stress that 
have been demonstrated to adversely affect health. They found that the greater the stress exposur e severity was throughout one’s life, the higher the likelihood of poorer mental and 
physical health. Chronic stress can also impact physical and cognitive health. Corr êa et al. 
(2018) found that familial caregivers of patients with Alzheimer’s disease su ffered cognitive 
impairments due to the stress of caregiving, which increased their own risk for cognitive decline.  
However, there are indications that some factors can buffer these adverse impacts of 
stress. For example, perceived self -efficacy has been found to buffer the impact of daily 
stressors, resulting in fewer symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress  (Sch önfeld et al., 
2016). This demonstrates that individuals with higher levels of self -efficacy can cope better 
with the daily stress of life. B eing better able to handle stress is also associated with increases 
in positive factors such as well -being (Rupert & Dorociak, 2019). Well -being is frequently 
used as a general population indicator to determine how individuals are coping with the daily stressors of life and how well one can maximize positive affect and minimize negative affect 
in the face of life stressors (Boggero & Segerstrom, 2019).  
The high prevalence rates of anxious and depressive symptoms, the adverse effects of 
stress on mental and  physical health, and the moderating impact of stress management and 
self-efficacy beliefs on these adverse effects, all support the extensive use of effective 
psychological therapies. Unfortunately, however, the majority of individuals in the United State s experiencing anxiety and mood disorders do not receive any treatment; an unmet need 
that is even worse for members of minority groups (Alegría et al., 2002). It seems reasonable to assume that an even greater percentage of those with anxious and depressi ve symptoms go 
untreated. Numerous factors likely contribute to such underutilization of psychological  3 
 
treatments, including financial and time constraints, as well as available treatments not 
meeting the needs of individual patients (Jones et al., 2014). Furthermore, stigma associated with help seeking for psychological concerns, cultural norms regarding identifying and seeking help for mental health concerns, and limited resources and availability of mental health professionals are also frequent concerns (Petros et al., 2016). Therefore, a need exists for interventions other than traditional psychotherapy, given that the latter can be difficult to attain due to financial limitations, stigma, time -constraints, and insufficient availability of 
therapists.  
Mental health applications (“apps”) have the potential to help address the needs of 
those experiencing mental health symptoms by addressing many of the current barriers to help- seeking. Applications are available to all with a smartphone and an internet conn ection. 
This makes the potential reach of mental health applications immense, as the majority of people in the United States (77%) own a smartphone device (Poushter et al., 2019). The 
accessibility of these applications is also served by their typically lo w cost, particularly when 
compared to traditionally delivered mental health services. Stigma and other factors 
associated with reduced help seeking can also be addressed by the fact that mental health applications offer privacy, convenient 24/7 access, dat a security, and the ability to use the 
application when alone (Erhardt & Dorian, 2017; Mani et al., 2015). Well -designed 
applications can replicate key components of many types of mental health interventions, including psychoeducation, self -monitoring, ski ll acquisition and practice, social support, and 
ongoing assessment. Many of these advantages of mental health applications were particularly salient during the severe restrictions imposed on much of the population by the coronavirus pandemic. Not only did the pandemic induce stress, anxiety, and other dysphoric 
mood states but the disruptions to traditional service delivery likely induced many to sample and benefit from these accessible, inexpensive options for stress and symptom reduction  4 
 
(Klussman et al. , 2021; Sorkin et al., 2021). Thus, interventions delivered through mobile 
applications would appear to appeal to adults in both the general and clinical population 
given their potential to decrease stress, anxiety, and depression while enhancing well -being.    
Mindfulness is among the interventions that have been translated for mobile 
application delivery.  There is evidence of the efficacy of mindfulness for reducing stress along with depressive and anxious symptoms (Medvedev et al., 2018) and enhancing w ell-
being (Lomas et al., 2019). Meditation and mindfulness interventions have also been associated with somatic relief for users. For example, Carissoli et al. (2015) found that participants who meditated using a 3 -week mindfulness -inspired protocol delive red via an 
android application reported a significant decrease in average heartbeats per minute after each session. As the popularity of mindfulness grows, more users are turning to mobile applications to both learn about, acquire, and use these tools. Not  only are mindfulness -based 
applications widely available (Tunney et al., 2017), but there may be a sizable number of 
people who prefer to receive meditation and mindfulness interventions via mobile 
applications rather than through traditional in -person me thods. Supporting this possibility is 
the explosive growth in the availability and adoption of mindfulness -based applications 
(Mani et al., 2015). The fact that mindfulness applications are proliferating, widely adopted, 
and promising with respect to addre ssing anxious and depressive symptoms in clinical and 
general populations demonstrates the need for a review of the literature to clarify what is currently known about the benefits and limitations of these tools and where future research efforts should be directed.    Overview of Relevant Research  
The Emergence of Mindfulness in Western Society  
According to Martin (1997) who conceptualized mindfulness using both eastern and 
western psychological literature, mindfulness is “a state of psychological freedom that occurs  5 
 
when attention remains quiet and limber, without attachment to any particular point of view” 
(p. 291- 292). Another definition of mindfulness that is common is “a nonjudging way of 
attending to the body, breath, sensations, thoughts, feelings, and external stimuli in the present moment” (Koerbel & Zucker, 2007, p. 266). Many in western society are familiar with mindfulness because of Mindfulness -Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) which was 
developed by Jon Kabat -Zinn in 1979 (2014). Kabat -Zinn (1982) f ound that half of the 
patients who enrolled in the 10- week MBSR course experienced a pain reduction of nearly 
50% in addition to improvements in mood and other psychiatric symptoms. These impressive results demonstrating that mindfulness could help users b etter regulate pain contributed to 
mindfulness and its benefits becoming more well- known. 
Mindfulness is now being utilized throughout Western Society. For example, 
mindfulness interventions are used in institutions such as schools, workplaces (Creswell, 2017), colleges (Shearer et al., 2016), forensic facilities (Lyons & Cantrell, 2016) , and even 
the military, spurred by research showing that mindfulness can help mitigate adverse effects 
of combat exposure including PTSD, depression, risky behaviors, funct ional impairment, and 
pain (Nassif et al., 2019). Mindfulness is also part of the growing behavioral health, self -help, 
and self -improvement movements. In 2012, 8% of adults reported using mindfulness, making 
it one of the top five complementary health app roaches among adults in the United States 
(Clarke, 2015). The emergence and dissemination of specific mindfulness -based 
interventions have also made mindfulness more popular and well -known in the United States. 
As previously noted, one widely used example is MBSR, which is typically an 8- week, 
group- based intervention focused on the direct experience of mindfulness through formal 
exercises and group discussions (Giannandrea et al., 2018).    6 
 
Limitations of Mindfulness Research  
Although the scientific study of mindfulness -based interventions has increased 
markedly over recent decades with promising results, several factors create limitations for 
research on mindfulness. First, research on mindfulness is complicated by the diverse nature of the construct itsel f, as there are many types of mindfulness practices. Consequently, 
mindfulness eludes easy or definitive characterization leading to competing definitions. Creswell (2017) defines mindfulness as a process of openly attending, with awareness, to one’s prese nt moment experience but there are many alternative definitions. As discussed by 
Davidson and Dahl (2018), research has focused on only a few types of the many types of mindfulness practice, excluding other types of practice that may have great potential.  
Second, it is unclear how well mindfulness interventions work across different 
populations. The availability and adoption of mindfulness interventions does not appear to be comparable across different groups. According to  Olano et al. (2015), mindfulness 
interventions, although widely available, have been primarily sought out and used by high 
socioeconomic status (SES), healthy, Caucasian individuals, but are underutilized in minority and low SES populations. This presents challenges for research since sam ples using largely 
white, healthy, and relatively affluent individuals could make it difficult to determine how results generalize to other groups, including the general population, clinical populations, and persons of color.   
Third, when looking at the r esearch, it is clear that there is a need for higher quality 
studies (Farias et al., 2016). For instance, many studies use non- active control conditions 
(e.g., wait -list controls) and generic outcome measures (e.g., quality of life) that preclude 
determina tion of what specific variables mindfulness may or may not affect. In particular, 
methodological limitations of this body of research make it more difficult to determine the effect of mindfulness interventions on clinical populations (Hedman -Lagerlöf et al., 2018;  7 
 
Medvedev et al., 2018). For example, it is difficult to determine how well mindfulness -based 
interventions work within clinical populations if the studies are lacking reliability in 
procedures for diagnostic assessment of participants and outcomes  (i.e., blinded outcome 
assessors). This is in addition to not checking key treatment characteristics such as treatment adherence and therapist competence which could possibly be confounding factors. Additionally, despite promising results regarding genera l effects, studies have not yet 
attended to potential moderating factors such as duration, intensity, and regularity of practice as well as whether mindfulness is utilized during common activities of daily living (Davidson & Dahl, 2018).  
Fourth, it is unc lear how mindfulness compares to other treatments. For instance, one 
meta -analysis found mindfulness to be more effective than relaxation training and cognitive 
trainings (Sedlmeier et al., 2018). However, this meta -analysis only evaluated adults from a 
non-clinical sample, so it is unclear whether the results regarding differential treatment 
efficacy apply to clinical populations.  
Fifth, there are significant challenges concerning mindfulness -based interventions that 
aim to promote mindfulness due to diff iculties in measuring the state of mindfulness and the 
skills needed to achieve it. Measuring levels of mindfulness is problematic, in part, because mindfulness does not have a set definition. Bergomi et al. (2013) argue that all eight of the mindfulness s cales they identified may not constitute an adequate measure of mindfulness 
because they do not provide a comprehensive assessment of all aspects of mindfulness in general population samples. Mindfulness scales focused on specific, often clinical populations, may not be applicable for use with the general population. Although the self -
report measures typically used in these studies are subject to various forms of bias and likely affected by interpretations of mindfulness that differ across populations, the use of objective measures (e.g., electroencephalogram [EEG], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) is limited  8 
 
by expense and lack of consensus regarding how they might validate a state of mindfulness 
(Bergomi et al., 2013). Adding to these limitations is the l ack of research that explores factors 
such as duration, intensity and regularity of practice, as well as whether mindfulness can be utilized during common activities of daily living thereby increasing its mobility (Davidson & Dahl, 2018).  
Sixth, even though Mindfulness has been around for thousands of years, the research 
is still lacking in regard to identifying how  the intervention works. Creswell (2017) has 
described how little is known about the specific mechanisms of mindfulness interventions and the ne ed to explore them to optimize clinical interventions involving mindfulness.  
Finally, treatment adherence is a concern for any intervention research. Mindfulness 
research has struggled with getting participants to use the intervention consistently over the  
course of a trial. Nam and Toneatto’s (2016) meta -analysis found that the majority of 
mindfulness randomized controlled trials (RCTs) had a 20% or higher attrition rate, which 
significantly affects the researcher’s ability to control for bias. Also proble matic is that 
information that might shed light on the reasons for attrition was not collected in most of the 
studies.  
Adverse Effects of Mindfulness.  Although mindfulness is associated with many 
different benefits (some of which are reviewed below), there has been limited examination of adverse effects. Croswell et al. (2017) report that there is little published empirical research on the prevalence, type, and severity of intense negative experiences and other adverse effects associated with mindfulness i nterventions (e.g., agitation, anxiety, discomfort, confusion). 
Mindfulness can cause physiological discomfort for some individuals, primarily at the beginning stage of practice. For example, Creswell et al. (2014) found that the effort used to become more  mindful during a stress task increased cortisol reactivity in subjects, though 
they were nonetheless able to continue the intervention and improve their emotion regulation  9 
 
skills. Meditation has been shown to exacerbate worries for some users. Chittaro an d 
Vianello (2016) found that several of their participants experienced more negative feelings 
when using a mindfulness application due to thinking more about their worries, whereas others reported that they could not decenter from all of their worries. Thi s suggests that not 
only might mindfulness be ineffective work for everyone, but it may exacerbate various forms of distress for some individuals. Although studies have yet to explore what variables might predict a negative response (e.g., level of experie nce with meditating), it is worth 
noting that discomfort from trying a new intervention is not unique to mindfulness and might be expected from any other interventions in which the individual is trying something new and challenging.     
Uncertainty About Ne cessary Dosage for Mindfulness.  A crucial question in regard to 
the benefits of meditating involves the “dosage” (viz., amount of guided instruction or practice) necessary to produce a favorable response. The dosage necessary for participants to 
receive th e benefits of mindfulness varies significantly between studies. For example, 
Carissoli et al. (2015) hypothesized that a 3 -week mindfulness program was not a sufficient 
duration to attain significant results in reducing stress and anxiety. Flett et al. (20 18) found 
that participants who utilized their mindfulness applications more often showed significant 
benefits in regard to college adjustment, mindfulness, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms after just 10 days of meditation sessions. The meaning of  this finding with respect 
to sufficient “dosage” of training is rendered less clear, however, by the fact that the duration of the meditations available ranged considerably and that the exact duration of the sessions was not reported.   
Kral et al. (2018) found that the amount of mindfulness practice was not significantly 
correlated with amygdala reactivity, which led the researchers to speculate that the amount of practice necessary to realize benefits could be influenced by other factors (e.g., prior  10 
 
experience with meditation, motivation, level of distress, training environment). For example, 
the necessary “dosage” required to obtain benefits may be reduced if training occurs in the context of a meditation retreat, where motivated individuals immerse the mselves in a 
controlled environment with fewer distractions from work or personal responsibilities, more social support, and a higher degree of accountability than is the case in other training environments. Factors related to dosage are an important area for future research so we can 
better understand the length of time necessary in different training conditions for one to experience the benefits of meditation after having started a routine.  
Uncertainty About Effects of Mindfulness in Clinical Populations . Research on 
meditation with clinical populations has been pursued by researchers who are curious about its potential to reduce symptoms in patients suffering from various types of mental illness. Lee et al. (2016) found that a 6- week mindfulness training  program produced modest benefits 
in adults with respect to attention and subjective well- being but no significant reductions in 
depression and anxiety. This suggests that some users will experience benefits from adding a 
meditation routine to their life b ut may not experience clinically relevant reduction in 
symptoms for mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression. However, Hedman-Lagerlöf et al. (2018) found that Mindfulness -Based Interventions (MBI’s) were efficacious 
for reducing depression. Currently, the literature may be somewhat mixed with respect to the 
benefits of mindfulness when applied as an intervention for clinical population. However, Goldberg et al. (2018) reported promising results in a recently conducted systematic review and me ta-analysis of 142 RCTs examining the efficacy of mindfulness -based interventions on 
clinical symptoms of mental health disorders. They found mindfulness interventions did not differ from evidence -based treatments and that their efficacy was most consisten tly supported 
for depression, pain conditions, smoking, and addictive disorders.    11 
 
Benefits of Mindfulness  
Despite the limitations discussed earlier, mindfulness has the potential to help people 
in a variety of ways. Even though research with mindfulness is still in its early stages, there 
are several promising avenues for its use. Most of all, it has been incorporated into certain efficacious psychotherapy models of treatment such MBSR and Mindfulness -Based 
Cognitive Therapy (MBCT; Giannandrea et al., 2018; Moir et al., 2019). MBSR has been associated with benefits in reducing stress, distress, and psychological symptoms among both clinical and nonclinical populations (Khoury et al., 2015). It is a popular intervention among the general population of the U nited States (Olano et al., 2015) and is appealing due to being 
an alternative to group sessions, convenient to use and offering objective measures of adherence (i.e., automatically collecting data to mark progress; Bostock et al. 2019).  
Decrease in Symptoms of Depression and Anxiety. Although not yet sufficiently 
studied, results pertaining to the impact of mindfulness on depression and anxiety are mixed 
but promising overall. As stated above, Goldberg et al. (2018) found convincing evidence 
that MBI ’s were effective for decreasing depressive symptoms, but not anxiety. In a study 
examining different facets of mindfulness training, Medvedev et al. (2018) found that 
fostering a non- judgmental attitude towards oneself was the most important factor for th e 
reduction of anxiety, stress, and depression in a nonclinical student population. Similarly, Petrocchi and Ottaviani (2016) found nonjudgment to be the only facet of mindfulness to predict reduced depressive symptoms in a sample of primarily Caucasian ad ult participants. 
The researchers speculated that nonjudgment along with self -compassion could help improve 
dispositional mindfulness, providing users with even more benefits in regard to lowering depressive symptoms. This demonstrates that a nonjudgmental , self -compassionate attitude 
learned from mindfulness can possibly help prevent or mitigate the symptoms of depression.  12 
 
Khoury et al. (2015) found that MBSR had moderate effects on nonclinical individuals for 
depression, anxiety and distress.  
 Other rese arch has also found mindfulness to have benefits with respect to anxiety 
symptoms. Penberthy et al. (2017) found that anxiety symptoms significantly decreased in participants who were assigned a Tibetan Buddhist meditation instruction and discussion class,  which helped them both learn and explore mindfulness and well -being. Lee and 
Zelman (2019) found that average or greater dispositional mindfulness was associated with lower negative affect such as anxiety. Gautam et al. (2019) found that all facets of mindfulness (non- judging, non- reacting, acting with awareness, observing and describing), 
except for observing, helped college students reduce procrastination due to lowered anxiety. In addition, being able to describe one’s internal state, which is a key fac et of mindfulness, 
was especially found to lower anxiety. Hertz, et al. (2015) found that individuals higher in mindfulness experienced less attachment anxiety during a conflict discussion possibly due to 
feeling more secure in the attachment with another as well as experiencing less subjective 
distress.  
Mindfulness Can Help Reduce Stress.  Khoury et al. (2015) found in their meta -
analysis of healthy individuals that MBSR interventions had a large effect in terms of 
reducing stress, especially among healthc are professionals. Additionally, MBSR’s lower 
attrition rate in comparison to cognitive -behavioral interventions (17% to 22.5%) suggested 
that participants were significantly committed to this treatment approach. In a systematic review of mindfulness -based  interventions (MBI) used in the workplace, Heckenberg et al. 
(2018) found participants who had used mindfulness -based interventions were more likely to 
have better regulated hypothalamic -pituitary -adrenal (HPA) axis, improved autonomic 
balance based on th eir heart rate variability (HRV) coherence ratio measure, better immune 
system functioning, and a decrease on some measures of inflammation. Gu et al. (2015)  13 
 
found that teachers who underwent a meditation training, which included emotion and 
attention skills training had less of an anticipatory stress response to a social stressor (viz., the Trier Social Stress Tests [TSST]). Singh et al. (2016) found that mindfulness was negatively associated with perceived stress in a sample of college students and sugges ted that 
mindfulness can help reduce the perception of stress by accepting the reality of the situation and letting go of things outside of one’s control. Medvedev et al. (2018) found that mindfulness can decrease stress related symptoms both in young and older adults. Ramasubramanian (2017) found that freshmen college students experiencing the stress of adjusting to college life were better able to cope with the stress and experienced less perceived stress after taking a 14 -week semester -long one credit se minar on mindful 
communication. Hertz et al. (2015) found that mindfulness may buffer the response against stress and thereby help couples become more adept at handling conflict in the relationship. They speculated that individuals high in mindfulness coul d better handle conflict by  
being more present to the situation due to having a more robust coping mechanism as 
indicated by having lower cortisol levels. Mindfulness may more specifically be able to lower perceived stress due to emotion regulation as sug gested by Prakash et al. (2015) whose 
findings revealed that enhanced emotion regulation was a possible mechanism that explained the stress -reducing capacity of dispositional mindfulness.  
 Mindfulness may be able to help those in situations prone to produce chronic stress. 
Cachia et al. (2016) found in their systematic review that mindfulness can reduce stress in parents of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Yang et al. (2017) found in a sample of Singaporean mental health professionals that all mindfulness facets were 
negatively associated with both stress and burnout, even when controlling for participants’ years of professional experience. This suggests that mindfulness can benefit individuals, at least in terms of stress reduction, regardless of their level of work experience. The positive  14 
 
effects of mindfulness on stress reduction have also been established in the military with 
Meland et al. (2015) finding that mindfulness significantly reduced the physiological stress response based on corti sol levels during a prolonged high- demand workload for a Norwegian 
military helicopter unit.  
Mindfulness Can Help Those Suffering from Addiction. A meta -analysis by Li et al. 
(2017) found mindfulness to have efficacy as a treatment for substance as evidenced by its small but significant effect on reducing substance misuse and medium effect on reducing craving. Additionally, mindfulness treatment had a large effect on reducing stress levels, which, in turn, contributed to its ability to help individuals bet ter resist the symptoms of 
withdrawal. This potential for mindfulness to play a role in substance use treatment by reducing elevated stress levels that often prompt relapse is further supported by Carroll and Lustyk (2018) who found that participants in a substance abuse care facility who completed the Mindfulness Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) program learned to deal with stress in a 
more adaptive, flexible manner, which could help prevent them from relapsing.  
Mindfulness Can Increase Well -Being and Help Gain Awareness of Mood.  As 
mentioned earlier, well -being is used to determine how individuals are coping with the daily 
stressors of life and how well one can maximize positive affect and minimize negative affect 
in the face of stressors. Mindfulness has been found to increase well -being (Beshai et al., 
2016). Christie et al. (2017) found that mindfulness increased well -being in separate samples 
of undergraduate and postgraduate students. The authors suggest that the increased well -
being was mediated by mi ndfulness’ encouragement to both clarify and act in accordance 
with one’s values. Mindfulness had also been found to increase well -being in parents caring 
for children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (Cachia et al., 2016). There are also indications that participation in a long -term meditation group can lead to more accurate perceptions of 
one’s internal state (Rosenkranz et al., 2016)   15 
 
Decrease in Emotional Reactivity.  Long -term mindfulness training has also been 
demonstrated to reduce emotional reactivity. For instance, Davidson et al. (2018) found that 
college participants who engaged in long- term mindfulness had less right amygdala 
activation when shown affective pictures in comparison to control groups. The researchers speculated that the results, alon g with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data 
from the participants, strengthened their hypothesis that individuals who engage in long- term 
mindfulness meditation can experience improved emotion regulation due to reductions in emotional reactivity to both negative and positive stimuli. This seems to fit with ideas stemming from contemplative traditions that one’s emotional reactivity can be reduced by no longer trying to avoid unpleasant feelings or gravitate towards pleasant experiences.  
Additi onal Benefits: Low Cost, Convenience, Extensive Training Not Required, and 
Use as an Adjunctive Treatment. Mindfulness has many characteristics likely to increase its appeal to newcomers. It can be used in a variety of settings, making it helpful for those  who 
are frequently on- the-go and have demanding schedules. Mindfulness is also not a costly 
intervention since it can technically be learned for free or at low -cost through the internet, 
applications, books, and group classes. Another appeal of mindfulnes s is that it does not 
require extensive training as studies have shown that benefits of mindfulness can be achieved by participants who engage in the practice as infrequently as 10 times during an 8- week 
intervention period (Bostock et al., 2019).  Additionally, mindfulness appears able to enhance other treatments as is the case of MBSR (Evans et al., 2018) and MBCT (James & Rimes, 2018), due at least in part to the increase in self -compassion that can result from increased 
mindfulness.  
Flexible Delivery M odels. There are indications that mindfulness interventions 
delivered through various forms of technology as opposed to traditional methods are both efficacious and well received by participants. Tunney et al. (2017) compared a mindfulness  16 
 
and relaxation i ntervention delivered through a traditional live face -to-face group with one 
delivered via a computer game avatar. They found that the computer -game delivery was well 
received by their sample of 10 to 12- year-old children who generally found the interventi on 
more engaging and less confusing in comparison to the face -to-face version. Furthermore, 
their analyses suggested that the potential mechanism of change involved the content of the 
exercises rather than being dependent upon any human- to-human interactio n. This is a 
notable finding since it indicates that mindfulness -based interventions delivered through 
technology can be just as beneficial as interventions given in a face -to-face context by a 
practitioner. The standardization of the mindfulness -based int erventions given via technology 
could be a potential benefit in reducing confusion associated with live human leaders such as unclear communication, omission of key details, and variation across leaders.  
Receptivity toward alternative delivery methods does not appear to be limited to 
youth.  A systematic review by Fish et al. (2016) demonstrated that adult participants, ages 
25-56, enjoyed the content of the mindfulness interventions being delivered by a variety of 
different technologies, including text, and audio/video (though animation was less popular). 
The authors concluded that there was evidence to support the claim that mindfulness -based 
interventions can be effectively delivered through technology in accordance with accepted mindfulness models.  
Efficacy of Interventions Delivered Via Mobile Applications 
Mobile applications have become increasingly popular for a wide variety of health 
and self -improvement related uses. These include exercising (Muntaner -Mas et al., 2019), 
reducing nicotine usage and other addictions (Spears et al., 2019), gaining emotional awareness (Bakker & Rickard, 2018), reducing stress and teaching stress management (Coulon et al., 2016; Dillon et al., 2016), relieving depression and promoting well -being 
(Bakker et al.,  2018), and teaching health -related skills (Flett et al., 2018). Mobile  17 
 
applications have even made their way into therapy, now being used as an adjunctive 
component of treatment (Bakker & Rickard, 2019). Wen et al. (2017) found that medical students using a mindfulness -based smartphone application experienced increases in both 
positive affect and in mindfulness scores while negative affect scores demonstrated no change. This indicates that mindfulness interventions via mobile application can help professio nals in demanding careers to reduce burnout since the study also found that the 
results applied regardless of the degree of distress that participants reported at baseline. Flett et al. (2018) found that participants who utilized mindfulness applications m ore often were 
more likely to show greater benefits in regard to college adjustment, mindfulness, depressive, and anxiety symptoms. Even more interesting is that their results indicated that significant improvements were found after just 10 days of using e ither the Headspace or Smiling Mind 
mindfulness -based application when compared to the control condition. Length of time 
necessary to demonstrate improvement is an important area for future research since it is 
difficult to assess how long it will take for one to experience benefits of meditation after 
having started a routine. Nonetheless, the current data suggest that mindfulness as an 
intervention does not require a large time commitment.  
Limitations of Mobile App lication s 
There are some limitations to u sing mobile applications. First, individuals must have 
sufficient financial resources to both obtain an internet -connected smartphone and to pay for 
applications, which increasingly rely on subscription models. Second, some users may be hampered by a lack of familiarity with applications and/or smartphone technology. Third, some users may not have reliable access to the internet, which could also impact their ability to download or use such applications (Tunney et al., 2017). Fourth, despite the abundance of available heath related applications, very few have been subjected to research to test their efficacy. This can make it difficult for health professionals and consumers to determine  18 
 
which applications are the best suited to help their clients or themselv es. For example, in 
2013, there were 1,536 depression- related applications available for download, but only 32 
published articles regarding depression applications (Martínez -Pérez et al., 2013). Similarly, 
over 85% of applications in England’s National Hea lth Service’s application library do not 
have scientific evidence to support them, making it impossible to determine how effective 
they are (Leigh & Flatt, 2015).  
Another important consideration is how mobile applications can be used most 
effectively. Although far from definitive, some current evidence suggests that mobile applications are more effective when used as adjunctive resources in the context of professionally delivered treatment than as stand -alone self -help resources (whether used by 
members of the general or clinical population). For example, Firth et al. (2017) found that 
utilizing smartphones to treat anxiety disorders was most effective when these devices were used to enhance and support the delivery of existing face -to-face or internet -based therapy 
programs. Another notable limitation is that few mental health applications have any 
empirical support and that many of those that do were developed specifically for research purposes and are not available to the public.  
There are several additio nal potential drawbacks associated with the use of 
applications to deliver mindfulness training. Due to the online nature of the applications, there are concerns about both consumer privacy and security as well as a lack of scientific evaluation regarding their effectiveness since only a minority (7%) of the mindfulness 
applications reviewed in European application stores by Schultchen et al. (2021) provided any evidence regarding their effectiveness. Furthermore, Schultchen et al. (2021) also found that 2% of the applications they reviewed offered user support such as hotline numbers in the case of a crisis or emergency, which could make applications less appealing for users who seek more immediate support should unexpected symptoms occur while engaging in  19 
 
mindfulness. Lastly, some applications may be less appealing or less effective because they 
lack an explicit teaching component or have poorly designed user -interfaces that render them 
difficult to use (Plaza et al., 2013).  
Benefits of Mobile Applications in Mental Health Care  
Despite these limitations, mobile applications have many advantages as well. Mobile 
applications are widely available via the app store platforms for both iPhone and Android. Some individuals may prefer mobile technology of applicatio ns due to relatively low cost, 
convenience, 24/7 availability and privacy protections (Erhardt & Dorian, 2017). Some individuals may prefer apps over face -to-face meetings due to typical barriers of treatment 
such as geographic distance, scheduling conflic ts, and transportation (Leigh & Flatt, 2015). 
Mobile apps can also be appealing due to many features they offer that allow users to hold themselves more accountable. These include reminders, notifications, encouraging messages, and support services. Some e ncouraging findings regarding the benefits of mental health 
applications when used as self -help tools with respect to depressive symptoms, anxious 
symptoms, and well -being suggest that they might also be useful as adjunctive tools to 
improve the efficacy and efficiency of professional therapy (Leigh & Flatt, 2015).  
Mobile applications have demonstrated that they can be valuable self -help tools. Their 
potential benefits include greater volume and accuracy of clinical data collected via self -
monitoring, progress tracking (e.g., via prompted measure completion and automatic charting), improved skill acquisition through increased density of practice in real- life 
situations, consolidation of therapeutic learning via psychoeducational components, and providing a means for support and guidance independent of the therapist that may encourage autonomy and facilitate termination of formal treatment. It was also found that users who used three different applications ( MoodKit, MoodPrism, and MoodMission ) as a self -help tool 
for either learning CBT strategies or self- monitoring their emotional well -being, experienced  20 
 
significant improvements in well -being (Bakker & Rickard, 2018). However, only Moodkit  
and MoodMission were found to decrease depressive symptoms suggesting that emotional 
awareness was not sufficient to decrease such symptoms, but rather increasing coping self -
efficacy led to improvements in mood. Additionally, none of the applications demonstrated any significant effects in decreasing anxiety.  
In addition t o their use as stand -alone, self -help resources, research has shown that 
this type of self -help tool can benefit those who are clinically depressed or anxious. In 
another study by the same authors, Bakker and Richard (2018) conducted a study in which participants who were not receiving therapy received CBT strategies after they reported their 
mood to the MoodMission  application when they were feeling sad or anxious. The results 
indicated significant improvements in coping self- efficacy and well -being in those who used 
the application regularly, especially by those who were subclinically or moderately depressed. However, such effects were not found with participants who had severe anxiety or 
depression, suggesting that such individuals likely require addition al resources (i.e., 
professional therapy) in combination with the MoodMission  application.  
Taken together, this raises the possibility that clients could use such mobile 
applications outside of therapy sessions as an adjunctive resource to enhance treatme nt, by 
continuing to practice skills that they are learning in therapy. This in turn could make therapy 
more effective due to the greater mastery of targeted skills. This also benefits the provider because it allows them to give more resources to their pat ients in the moments they are not 
there, in addition to empowering the client to take charge of their mental health when not in a session with their therapist. Having resources available via the mobile application in the moment they are needed could also h elp clients develop more self -efficacy (Dillon et al., 
2016). Based on these encouraging findings which include the benefits of mental health applications when used as adjunctive tools with respect to depressive symptoms, anxious  21 
 
symptoms, and well -being s uggest that they might also be useful as adjunctive tools to 
improve the efficacy and efficiency of professional therapy.  
COVID- 19 and the Increased Use of Mindfulness 
 The COVID -19 pandemic officially began on March 11th, 2020, when the World 
Health Orga nization (WHO) declared it a global pandemic (Johnson et al., 2021). This 
resulted in lockdowns and quarantines throughout the world. This was done to inhibit the 
spread of the virus and to lessen the burden of hospitals which were at risk of becoming overwhelmed. However, there were many unintended consequences of these precautions. 
First responders such as police officers, who were expected to help carry out these precautions, experienced increases in stress due to having to adapt their policing to avoid contracting the virus amid a shortage of personal protective equipment (PPE) in addition to being disliked because of enforcing unpopular measures to help reduce the spread of the virus (Stogner et al., 2020). Within the medical community, there were significant challenges 
encountered with enforcing social distancing measures at hospitals and concerns about giving 
care to patients via telehealth due to some patients being unable to utilize the technology 
necessary for such appointments. Due to the stay -at-home orders, individuals also 
experienced increased loneliness, family conflicts, and domestic violence (Johnson et al. 2021). According to an analysis of twitter posts in the United States from March 13th to May 6th by Guntuku et al. (2020), there were significant increases in tweets mentioning anxiety, stress, and loneliness when compared to 2019. Otu et al. (2020) speculated that the significant increase in time spent watching various media sources to obtain information concerning COVID- 19 would likely increase individuals' anxiety.  
To help address this, headspace began to offer their services for free to healthcare 
workers for the remainder of 2020 and gave the general public access to some of their content such as articles and guided meditations (Headsp ace, n.d.; Young, 2020). Several other  22 
 
applications followed suit, and this ultimately resulted in a substantial increase in the 
awareness of mindfulness for coping. This no doubt has brought about an increase in mindfulness to multiple sectors of the popu lation who had been previously unaware of its use 
and benefits. Furthermore, research has shown that some of these applications have been effective in mitigating the deleterious effects of COVID -19 on mental health. A study by Sun 
et al. (2021) found that a mindfulness -based mobile application had a high retention rate 
among its users (young adult Chinese students who were in quarantine) as well as demonstrated a superior effect against anxiety and improved depressive symptoms. Although there has been signi ficant progress made in combating COVID -19, many researchers caution 
that these psychological effects will be felt for years to come (Galea et al., 2020).  Rationale, Primary Aim(s), and Key Research Questions  
The aim of the proposed systematic review is to examine the evidence for using 
mindfulness -based mobile applications to reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety, lessen 
stress, and enhance well -being in both general population and clinical adult samples. 
Conducting the review should help the general population make more informed decisions about which applications to use and clinicians to make more informed decisions about which applications to suggest to clients, whether for use in sessions, out of session s, or following the 
discontinuation of therapy. Mindfulness has now become popular within western culture and is being utilized as an alternative treatment for a variety of symptoms (Teresa & Sy, 2012). 
Although there are questions about the scope and magnitude of its efficacy, it remains a 
popular intervention among the general public and is now commonly being used in therapy through such modalities like MBSR and MBCT (Teresa & Sy, 2012). Additionally, subsequent to the immense growth of smartphone use by the general population (Poushter et al., 2019), mobile applications have become both a popular and appealing way to receive health -related interventions due to their low cost and accessibility for consumers (). As a  23 
 
result, mindfulness interventions are in creasingly being used by the public and by clinicians 
through mindfulness -based mobile applications (Krebs & Duncan, 2015).  
However, resources are lacking to educate those considering the use of mindfulness -
based mobile applications with respect to their established benefits and limitations. 
Therefore, the aim of the proposed project is to conduct a systematic review of the current literature to better clarify the benefits, limitations, and future directions of mindfulness based mobile applications in orde r to better inform members of the general public seeking 
mindfulness -based self -help resources and treatment providers who wish to integrate such 
applications into their clinical work with adult clients or to recommend them as adjunctive treatments.  
The k ey research questions are the following:  
• What benefits are associated with the use of mindfulness -based applications for 
clinical and general population adults with respect to stress, symptoms of anxiety, and 
symptoms of depression?  
• Have mindfulness -based  applications been found to enhance well -being for clinical 
and general population adults?  
• What limitations have been identified with respect to the use of meditation -based 
applications for clinical and general population adults?

Chapter 2: Method ology 
Systematic Review Approach  
A systematic review utilizing a narrative synthesis was used to identify, review, and 
synthesize the findings from studies concerning the impact of mindfulness -based mobile apps 
on specific aspects of psychological functioning in both the general population and clinical 
groups. A systematic review was chosen due to it being considered the “gold standard” concerning literature reviews that assess specific research questions to provide evidence-based answers and better inform  the public (Boland et al., 2017). The author was given 
approval by the IRB board at Pepperdine University on 7/14/2020 (see Appendix A). The aim of this systematic review was to clarify the conclusions warranted based on the extant literature regarding th e benefits, limitations, and future directions of mindfulness -based 
mobile apps with respect to enhancing well -being and reducing depressive symptoms, anxiety 
symptoms, and stress among clinical and general population adults. Furthermore, a narrative synthesis has been found to be a useful tool in the assessment of complex interventions 
concerning data from different study designs that are not easily combined for analysis (Ryan, 2013). Given that the research of mindfulness -based mobile apps is still in its  infancy, a 
narrative synthesis approach was deemed appropriate.  
Eligibility Criteria  Inclusion Criteria  
Source Eligibility Criteria.  Studies eligible for inclusion were published as English 
language articles in peer -reviewed academic journals between t he years 2009 and 2021. 
Additionally, the studies must have examined publicly available and accessible mindfulness -
based mobile apps downloadable to iOS or Android smartphones. 
Study Eligibility Criteria.  Studies eligible for inclusion must have involved general 
population or clinical participants over the age of 18 years and included quantitative self - 25 
 
report measures related to depressive symptoms, anxious symptoms, stress (including self -
report and physiological assessments), and/or well -being. For studies addressing well -being, 
there had to be a self -report measure that specifically measures well -being. Studies had to 
examine the use of mobile apps in delivering mindfulness interventions.  
Exclusion Criteria  
Although the review includes the cli nical population, it is considered beyond the 
scope of this study to include clinical disorders that are considered “serious mental illness.” 
Therefore, studies relying on inpatient populations or participants with psychotic disorders (schizophrenia, etc.)  or psychotic symptoms (i.e., bipolar disorder with psychotic symptoms, 
etc.) were excluded. Furthermore, studies assessing populations with personality disorders, manic symptoms, substance use and symptoms of trauma and stressor related disorders such as Post -Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) were also excluded. In order to reduce potential 
confounding variables, such as amelioration of psychological symptoms from other 
interventions, studies that utilized mindfulness -based interventions with significant 
components of therapeutic modalities (i.e., acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT), 
cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) etc.) were also 
excluded. Lastly, studies utilizing other technologies in conjunction with mobile apps such as virtual reality (VR), neurofeedback, electroencephalogram (EEG), etc. were excluded.  
Search, Screening, and Selection Processes  
Information Sources. Relevant studies were identified through the electronic search of 
Elton B. Stephens CO (company) (EBSCO), which has a robust selection of databases. Additionally, the home pages of Headspace and Calm were reviewed to identify any 
published studies related to those apps.  
Search Terms.  Search terms for EBSCO were identified via a preliminary search of 
the literature and in consultation with the head librarian of Pepperdine University. The search  26 
 
terms thereby consisted of the following: (a) Mobile apps included: “app or mobile app or 
apps or mobile device applications or mobile apps or smartphone; (b ) Mindfulness included: 
“meditat* or mindful*;” (c) Effectiveness included: “efficacy or effectiveness or impact or benefits or outcomes;” (d) Psychological symptoms included: “well -being” or “stress or 
anxiety or depression;” The operator AND was used to combine these search terms. Furthermore, search terms were made to not  include the following in order to enhance the 
exclusionary criteria: (e) Adolescents: “teenagers or adolescents or teens or youth;” (f) ACT: “acceptance and commitment therapy;” (g) CBT : “cognitive behavioral therapy;” (h) Virtual 
Reality: “virtual reality or VR or augmented reality;” and (i) Computers: “computers or laptops.” These search terms were likewise included by including the operator NOT (See Table 1 for the search documentatio n record). Lastly, specifiers were made to include peer -
reviewed articles between the years 2009 -2021.  
The finalized search syntax utilized on EBSCO on 01/09/2022 consisted of 187 
articles; however, after duplicate articles had been removed (71 duplicate articles) there were 
a total of 116 articles remaining.  
For the published studies available on the official website of Calm and Headspace, the 
articles were checked on 12/08/2021 to ensure that they were peer reviewed and had been published between the ye ars 2009- 2021. Given the Calm and Headspace app’s relevance to 
this research, and that both are popular mindfulness -based mobile apps, there was no 
additional search procedure deemed necessary. This resulted in 10 articles from the Calm website and 25 arti cles from the Headspace website, leaving a total of 35 articles. Notably, 
the Calm website listed 5 ongoing studies which were unable to be retrieved. No duplicate articles were identified during this search. The first round of screening resulted in 15 articles from the Calm and Headspace website being removed due to not meeting the inclusionary and exclusionary criteria. The 20 remaining articles were likewise given a full text review to  27 
 
further determine if they met the inclusionary and exclusionary crite ria of this review. After 
the first phase of screening titles and abstracts for EBSCO (see below for full description of 
two-round screening process), there were 90 articles left and 9 additional duplicate articles 
were identified in the EBSCO search due t o the hand search of two popular mindfulness app 
websites (see below; 2 articles from the Calm website and 6 articles from the Headspace website). This resulted in the remaining 81 articles being reviewed via full text to further determine if they met the inclusionary and exclusionary criteria of this review. 
Selection of Studies. The process for identifying studies for the proposed review 
consisted of two rounds of screening. The first round of screening consisted of the titles and abstracts of articles id entified via the search described above to be reviewed to determine if 
they meet the review’s inclusionary and exclusionary criteria. Duplicate articles were identified and deleted. To reduce bias and errors, the first round of screening was done separatel y by a second reviewer (research assistant) utilizing the same method. If there were 
any differences noted, the author and research assistant would discuss (until consensus was 
met) whether the reference was appropriate to continue to the second phase of s creening (see 
Appendix B).  
The second round of screening consisted of a data extraction process of the articles 
identified via the prior screening and consisted of the following steps: (a) The data collection and extraction were performed by the author and research assistant to ensure that they met the review’s inclusionary and exclusionary criteria. Furthermore, if there was insufficient information in the abstract and title, then the full text was retrieved to further evaluate if the article met the inclusion or exclusion criteria. Any articles that had conflicting eligibility criteria or where the decision regarding inclusion/exclusion was unclear, were included temporarily until both the author and research assistant discussed whether the reference was appropriate for final inclusion; (b) a random subset of the initial forms (30% of the total  28 
 
selected studies) completed by the author was checked by the research assistant and vice 
versa for accuracy and to reduce bias. The random subset of forms assigned to both the author and the second reviewer was done through the random number generator app. If there were any inconsistencies in the author and research assistant’s extraction data, the finalized entries were determined collaboratively by the author and r esearch assistant, and lastly; (c) 
the data extraction forms were stored electronically on google forms which then converted the data onto a Microsoft Excel sheet. All studies reviewed, after having passed the two rounds of screening, had their data extrac ted onto a data collection form using Microsoft 
Excel (see Appendix C). Figure 1 shows a PRISMA Flow Diagram which was designed to visually summarize the process of selecting the final set of studies for the systematic review. It included the key steps and methods used to obtain the final set of studies which included the sources of the articles (database and other), the elimination of duplicate articles, and the two-step screening process (title/abstract search, and context/full text search).  
Data Collect ion and Extraction  
Data collected from eligible studies served as the basis for answering the research 
questions involving the benefits, limitations, and future directions pertaining to the effects of mindfulness -based mobile apps on depressive symptoms, anxious symptoms, stress, and 
well-being among clinical and general population adults. Specifically, a data extraction form 
adapted from the Cochrane Collaboration was used to record the relevant variables for each of the studies included in the review. Th e form was converted to google forms which then 
converted the data onto a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet (Appendix C). It included the following information: Document ID, authors’ names, full document title, research variables of the study, research variables  of the review; General Information included: name of person 
extracting data, if reviewer was completing form as a secondary reviewer, date form was completed, source name, if the source was peer reviewed/published, year it was published,  29 
 
document language ; Design characteristics and methodological features: type of mindfulness 
app utilized, if app was available and accessible to general public, duration and frequency of 
meditation, if mindfulness app utilized a significant component of a therapeutic modali ty/other technology to deliver mindfulness intervention, aim of the study, method of 
study (quantitative, qualitative, mixed), specific design or research approach, differences in dosage and frequency of mindfulness intervention; Assessment of Research Var iables: type 
of measure used for anxiety, depression, stress, well -being, as well as measures of reliability 
and validity; Study Participant Characteristics and Recruitment: population of interest, recruitment methods, sample size, age range, gender, diagnosis, education level, nationality, ethnicity, marital status, religion, socioeconomic status, occupation, languages spoken; Setting Characteristics: Study location, data collection setting; Results: results for anxiety, depression, stress, well -being, med itation duration/frequency, attrition rate, adherence rate; 
Conclusions and Follow -up: conclusion and recommendations of study authors, 
interpretations based on the results ability to answer the research questions of the review, 
implications for practice, study limitations, potential conflict of interest, and follow -up (if 
necessary).  
Quality Appraisal   
A quality appraisal form was utilized to determine the quality and strength of the 
studies retrieved. Specifically, the form assessed the strength of literature foundation and rationale for study, clarity and specificity of research aims/objectives/questions, quality of research design methodological approach, sample selection and characteristics, measures/data collection tools, data collection, analysis of  data, diversity/cultural issues, discussion of study 
limitations, and an overall rating. The purpose was to better inform the review’s questions regarding the strength of the literature to support potential benefits of mindfulness apps in ameliorating the  psychological symptoms specific to the review. The quality appraisal of  30 
 
included studies occurred during the data extraction phase of the project, after the selection of 
studies for the review had been finalized. The appraisal was made based on an Individual Study Quality Assessment  form (see Appendix D). As guided by the Individual Study Quality 
Assessment  form, each study was assessed in a range of domains using the following scale: 
Strong (3 points), Good/Adequate (2 points), Weak (1 point), Missing (0 points), or Not Applicable.  
Data Management, Synthesis, and Analysis Plan  
Due to the research of mindf ulness- based mobile apps being in its infancy, a narrative 
synthesis was chosen to analyze the data obtained throughout the review. A narrative synthesis is when the results of a study are presented primarily via written explanation but can include graphs and other visual tools to illustrate the findings of the study (Boland et al., 
2017). A Microsoft Excel sheet was used for recording and storing data collected for the review. A narrative synthesis of study characteristics and data pertinent to the research 
questions was made based on careful review of the data extraction and quality appraisal 
forms. As shown in Table 2, an Evidence Base for Research Questions Table presented 
information on the volume of studies, quality of studies, and results/conclusions of studies pertinent to the research questions of this review based on the data extraction and Individual Study Quality Assessment forms. The basis for excluding all rejected studies was recorded (see Appendix E).

Chapter 3: Results  
 The purpose of this research was to review the current literature to clarify the benefits, 
limitations, and future directions of mindfulness -based mobile apps to better inform members 
of the general public seeking mindfulness -based self -help resources and treatment providers 
who wish to integrate such apps into their clinical work with adult clients or to recommend 
them as adjunctive treatments. The review sought to answer the following questions: (a) What benefits are associated with the use of mindfulness -based apps for clinical and general 
population adults with respect to stress, symptoms of anxiety and symptoms of depression? (b) Have mindfulness -based apps been found to enhance well -being for clinical and general 
population adults? (c) What limitations hav e been identified with respect to the use of 
meditation -based apps for clinical and general population adults?  
Selection Results of the Review  
Screening Process Results  
 As shown in Figure 1, a total of 187 articles were identified through the electronic 
database search utilizing EBSCO. After 71 duplicates were removed, 116 articles remained for screening. Additionally, a separate search done on the official website for both Calm and Headspace applications was conducted. This search yielded 35 articles, non e of which were 
duplicates. When the articles were combined, 10 additional duplicate articles were identified, leaving a total of 141 articles. These articles were run through title and abstract screening for 
basic eligibility pertaining to the inclusionary and exclusionary criteria. Following the first 
round of screening, there were 81 articles remaining for the second round of screening, which included a full text review as well as the completion of the data extraction and critical quality appraisal form if the article met full criteria for the purposes of this review. A total of 52 
articles were eliminated during the second round of screening. Ultimately, 29 articles were eligible for inclusion in the study.   32 
 
Excluded Studies  
The primary reason for article s being excluded during phase I was that the study did 
not utilize a mindfulness app ( n = 19). This was closely followed by the article not measuring 
relevant psychological factors (i.e., anxiety, depression, stress and well -being) pertaining to 
the review  (n = 17). Although a limiter was made to exclude dissertations and other gray 
literature, there were nine articles that were excluded due to being either a research proposal 
or application review with no self -report measures/data. Despite having limiters for 
therapeutic modalities such as CBT and ACT, there were five articles that did use significant components, the most common being behavioral activation. There were four articles that exclusively used qualitative data. Limiters were also made for other technologies that deliver mindfulness interventions such as VR or augmented reality, and two articles were found to have used such technologies. Furthermore, two articles were found to include participants with serious mental illness such as personality diso rders, so they were excluded. Notably, 
only one article was excluded due to the mindfulness application not being publicly available 
to the public. Limiters were made to exclude non -adult populations; however, there was one 
article that had a sample of chi ldren and adolescents. Lastly, 10 additional articles were 
discovered to be duplicates when the articles from EBSCO and the Calm and Headspace websites were combined.  
During the second phase of screening, the most common reasons for exclusion of 
studies w ere as follows. Many of the studies excluded either did not include a mindfulness 
application or instead used another type of health- related application (e.g., weight -loss 
application, smoking cessation application; n = 14). Several of the studies did not use a public 
available mindfulness application ( n = 11) or did not measure the psychological variables 
pertaining to this review (n = 7). There were studies that lacked any self -report measures to 
demonstrate significant changes in psychological variables pertaining to this review ( n = 6) or  33 
 
used a significant component of a therapeutic modality ( n = 5). Several studies included 
participants with serious mental illness (n = 5). A minority of studies were research proposals 
or responses to editor articles (n = 3) or included adolescents and children in their sample ( n 
=1).  Results of the Included Studies  
Mindfulness Applications  
Of the 29 included studies, Headspace was the most prominent application featured in 
the review ( n =19) followed by Calm ( n = 4). There were other mindfulness applications that 
were analyzed such as Smiling Mind, Mindful You, Mindapps, Mindfulness Coach, Tension Tamer, and Stop Breathe & Think (see figure 2 for all mindfulness applications included in this review). Each of these mind fulness applications were featured in only one study except 
for Tension Tamer (n = 2). All of these mindfulness applications are available via the Apple store except for Tension Tamer, which is on the Android store. It should be noted that 
Mindapps is available in the Apple store, but because it is a German application, users must 
go to the German Apple store to utilize it. All of the mindfulness applications were developed by private companies with the exception of Mindfulness Coach, which was designed by the 
VA to help Veterans both learn and practice Mindfulness (U.S. Department of Veteran 
Affairs, n.d.).  
Duration of Mindfulness Intervention via Mobile App  
Several mindfulness applications asked participants to meditate for 10 minutes daily 
(n = 15, 51%). Six (20%) of the studies asked participants to meditate 10 -20 minutes daily, 
and six (20%) of the studies did not ask for a set amount of meditation to be completed daily. Two (6%) studies, one which used The Mindapp, and the other Tension Tamer, asked participants to meditate twice a day (i.e., 10 -15-minute meditations each time). The study 
featuring The Mindapp was the only study that encouraged participants to do more than the  34 
 
prescribed amount of meditation. There was one study that was two weeks or shorter, twenty-
two (75%) studies that were 2 -10 weeks long and six (20%) studies that lasted three months 
or longer.  
Psychological Variables Measured  
The most common psychological variable pertaining to the review that was analyzed 
by the included studies was stress ( n = 20; 68%). Both stress and distress were included under 
the term “stress.” Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction was originally designed to help individuals suffering from chronic pain and stress; therefore, this pattern follows existing resear ch regarding the origins of mindfulness as an intervention in the West (Kabat-Zinn, 
1982). Anxiety and depression were both measured in 33% ( n =10) studies, and this is likely 
due to them being measured together frequently on self- report measures such as t he Hospital 
Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) rather than separately (see self -report measures 
below). Only one (5%) study measured anxiety separately and three (15%) measured 
depression separately. Well-being was the least frequent psychological variabl e present in the 
included studies ( n = 6; 30%); however, this likely was due to the requirement of this review 
that self -report measures had to specifically measure well -being instead of other constructs 
such as life satisfaction, and so on. 
Research Desig n 
In sum, there were 15 randomized controlled trials (RCT), three pilot studies, one 
prospective self -controlled studies, one prospective cohort study, one secondary analysis, one 
single-group pilot intervention, one evidence-based practice (EBP), one qual ity improvement 
(QI) initiative, one single arm trial, and one within subjects pre -post design. Three studies did 
not report the type of research design employed, and one of these studies reported it was 
developed as part of a future randomized trial. Take n together, a little more than half of the  35 
 
studies utilized a RCT design (51%) while the next most common research design was a pilot 
study (10%). Each other research design encompassed 3% of the total studies included.  Self-Report Measures  
There were 10 (34%) studies that used self- report measures for anxiety. These 
included measures such as the National Institutes of Health Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (NIH PROMIS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS -21), and Patient- Health Questionnaire - 4 
(PHQ-4). The most common self-report measure used for anxiety was the HADS (n=6; 60%), followed by the NIH PROMIS ( n = 2; 20%), DASS-21 ( n =1; 10%) and PHQ-4 ( n =1; 10%).  
Regarding self- report measures for depression, there were 18 (62%) studies . These 
included the National Institutes of Health Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (NIH PROMIS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS -21), Beck’s Depression Inventory (BDI), Center for 
Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale- 10 (CESD -10), Patient- Health Questionnaire - 8 
(PHQ- 8), Patient- Health Questionnaire - 4 (PHQ- 4), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule 
(PANAS) and the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES -D). The most 
common measure used for depression was the HADS ( n = 6; 33%), followed by the PANAS 
(n = 4; 22%), CES- D (n = 2; 11%), NIH PROMIS (n = 2; 11%), PHQ-4 ( n = 1; 5%), PHQ-8 
(n = 1; 5%), BDI ( n = 1; 5% ), and DASS-21 ( n = 1; 5%).  
There were 19 (65%) studies that used self -report measures for stress, and three 
studies used physiological measures for stress.  The self -report measures were the following: 
Perceived Stress Scale (PSS -4; PSS-10), Depression Anxiety Stress Scale (DASS -21), The 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network Distress Thermometer, and the Stress Overload Scale (SOS). One self -report measure was in German but was translated into English 
(“Änderungssensitive Symptomliste zu Entspannungserleben, Wohlbefinden, Beschwerden-  36 
 
und Problembelastungen”, list of change sensitive symptoms of relaxation, well-being, 
exposure to discomforts and difficulties, ASS-SYM; Krampen, 2006). Notably, instruments 
such as blood pressure monitors were used to capture changes in the physiological stress of their participants, however, these studies were a minority in this review ( n = 3; 15%). The 
blood pressure monitors used were the GE Carescape V100 monitor, Omron R2 wrist BP monitor and Spacelabs Healthcare 90207 am bulatory monitor.  
As stated previously, self -report measures concerning well -being were only 
considered if they explicitly reported measuring well-being rather than other variables such as quality of life. There were only six self- report measures for well -being and these included the 
Well -Being Index (WBI), Warwick- Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale (WEMWBS), 
General Well -Being Schedule (GWBS -38) and Short Warwick Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing 
Scale (SWEMWBS). The most common self -report measure used for well -being was the 
WEMWBS ( n = 3; 50%), followed by the WBI ( n = 1; 16%), GWBS-38 ( n = 1; 16%) and 
SWEMWBS ( n = 1; 16%).  
Demographic Information of Participants 
Population of interest  
The populations of interest in this review encompassed primarily incoming or current 
college students ( n = 5; 17%), including medical students (n  = 3; 10%). A moderate amount 
of the studies included cancer patients (n = 4; 13%), of which, two also included their caregivers. One study conducted their research during the COVID-19 pandemic and specifically sought to address questions pertaining to mental health during this time for pregnant women ( n = 1; 3%). Another study sought pregnant women who were experiencing 
perinatal depression (n = 1; 3%). Two studies included medical profess ionals, one which 
consisted of emergency department staff and the other included nurses and nurse practitioners. One study specifically sought to have all their participants be individuals who  37 
 
identified as African American. Other studies’ populations of i nterest included the geriatric 
population ( n = 1; 3%), caregivers of adults with cognitive impairment ( n = 1; 3%), and 
prehypertensive adults ( n = 1; 3%). Another study’s population of interest was patients who 
had experienced multisystem trauma ( n = 1; 3% ). One study aimed to look at a community 
sample of women living in southern Louisiana. Some studies specifically looked at general 
adult populations between 19- 64 years old ( n = 2; 6%) or 18 -49 years old ( n = 1; 3%). Two 
studies featured adult participants who were experiencing high levels of stress at work environments such as high- tech companies and pharmaceuticals. One study examined 
participants who were happiness seekers ( n = 1; 3%). Lastly, one study s ought participants 
who were police employees from five forces based in the United Kingdom (Avon and Somerset, Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, Hertfordshire and South Wales).  Age Range  
It was common for the studies to report the age of their participants (86%; n = 25), yet 
13% ( n =4) did not report the specific ages of their participants, and instead, stated they were 
adults (e.g., 18 years or older, 21 years or older). 20% of studies ha d a mean age ranging 
from 18 -30 (n = 6) and 24% studies had a mean age ranging from 30- 40 (n = 7). 17% ( n =5) 
of studies had a mean age range from 40- 65, and 3% ( n =1) of studies’ mean age was 70 
years old. One (3%) study specifically investigated the geri atric population (i.e., 65 years or 
older), and 17% ( n =5) of studies did not report a mean age, but instead, reported the age 
range which consisted of 19- 64, 20- 39, 18- 80, 18- 49, 19- 39.  
Gender 
Overall, across all studies, there were 4,871 participants. N otably, three studies did 
not include any demographic data concerning gender, one of which had a participant sample of 1,337. In total, concerning the studies that included the self -identified gender of its  38 
 
participants, 60.13% ( n = 2,125) of participants were female, 39.8% ( n = 1,408) were male, 
and <1% ( n = 3) indicated “other.”  
Education level  
Approximately 79% ( n = 23; 1,985 participants) of the studies included the 
educational level of participants. 13% ( n = 270) of participants had less than a colleg e degree, 
22% ( n = 440) were attending college at the time of the study, <1% (n = 8) had an Associate's 
degree, 51% ( n = 1,014) had a bachelor's degree, 8% ( n = 171) were in a graduate school 
(e.g., medical students, medical residents, trainees), and 4% ( n = 82) had a graduate degree.  
Race  
A little more than half the studies included in this review reported the race of their 
participants (65%, n = 19, 1,817 participants). The breakdown of the participants by race was 
the following: 6% (n = 119) were Black o r African American, <1% (n = 3) were Native 
American/Alaskan, 2% ( n = 37) were Hispanic or Latino/a, 6% ( n = 112) were Asian , 2% ( n 
= 38) were Biracial/Multiracial, 2% (n = 40) were Maori or Pasifika, <1% ( n = 9) were 
Indian, 4% ( n = 77) were Other , <1% ( n = 6) preferred to not respond, and 70% ( n = 1,281) 
were White. <1% ( n = 5) were not identified in the studies, and 5% (n = 93) were specifically 
identified as “Non- Hispanic Black or Other/Multi/Hispanic”.   
Marital Status  
There were 11 studies that collected information about their participants’ marital 
status (37%; 1,055 participants). The breakdown of the participants’ ma rital status is the 
following: 70% (n = 745) were married or partnered, 21% ( n = 232) of participants were 
single, 3% ( n = 42) were divorced, 1% ( n = 19) were widowed, <1% ( n = 8) common law 
marriage, <1% ( n = 6) of participants were separated, and <1% ( n = 3) were not reported.   39 
 
Religion  
Only one (<1 %) of the studies accounted for the religion of its participants. Of the 
religions represented in this study, there were those who indicated Other (e.g., religious 
science, spiritual; n = 15; 41%), non -denominational Christian (n = 8; 20.5%), no religion at 
all (n = 8; 20.5%), Baptist ( n = 3; 7.6%), Protestant (n = 2; 5.1%), and Catholic ( n = 2; 5.1%).  
Socio -Economic Status  
Eight of the included studies gathered information concerning the socio- economic 
status of their participants (n = 553 participants). Regarding lower to middle socioeconomic status, the following was reported: 21% (n = 119) of participants earned <50,000, 18% ( n = 
100) earned >50,000, 11% ( n = 69) earned $21,000- $74,999, 9% ( n = 52) earned >$ 61,000, 
8% ( n = 49) earned <29,999, 7% ( n = 39) earned <$75,000, and five participants did not 
report their income (<1%). Concerning high socioeconomic status, the following was reported: 9% (n =78) earned ≥100,000, 6% ( n = 41) earned<100,000, and <1% ( n = 1) earned 
>$75,000.  
Occupation  
A total of 16 studies (55%; 2,643 participants) collected information from their 
participants pertaining to their occupational status. These studies reported the following occupations: 25% ( n = 682) of participants were s tudents, 50% ( n = 1,337) were police force 
workers, 13% ( n = 171) were residents or trainees, 10% ( n = 142) were nurses, 9% ( n = 120) 
were pharmaceutical workers, 8% ( n = 113) were high tech workers, 3% ( n = 51) were 
retired, 2% ( n = 35) were doctors, <1% ( n = 12) were nurse practitioners, <1% ( n = 12) were 
other health care staff, <1% (n = 11) were administrative staff at a hospital, and <1% ( n = 3) 
were teachers. An additional 10% ( n = 3) of the total studies mentioned that their participants 
worked but declined to specify the occupation.   40 
 
Languages Spoken  
Only two of the studies gathered information related to the language or languages that 
the participants spoke; however, this was due to the exclusion criteria. The two studies 
reported that their participants had to speak English to be included in the study because their 
mindfulness app was not available in any other language but English. No other article mentioned the language of their participants.  
Previous Experience with Mind fulness  
Nearly half ( n = 16; 55%) of the studies did not report if their participants had any 
experience with mindfulness. Of the studies that did report these data ( n = 13; 44%; see 
figure 3 for levels of mindfulness experience participants had entering the included studies), 
most allowed those who had prior experience meditating to be included ( n = 11; 84%), eight 
of which the meditation experience was limited (61%; e.g., participants had used an application -based mindfulness program previously but were not currently) and two (15%) 
studies did not include participants who had meditated previously in their lifetime. Notably, 
for the studies that allowed previous meditation experience, the portion of their sample who endorsed previous mindfulness experience  ranged from 20% -95%. Some of these studies had 
exclusion criteria, which limited the participants current meditative practice prior to entering the study if a participant meditated regularly (n = 3; 23%), or more specifically, if they had 
meditated for mo re than 20 minutes over the past six months ( n = 1; 7%), had practiced 
meditation for more than 20 minutes ( n = 1; 7%), or had practiced at all in the previous six 
months ( n = 1; 7%).  
Settings  
The included studies encompassed a total of eight countries. T he vast majority of the 
studies took place in the United States ( n = 15; 51%), with some taking place in the United 
Kingdom ( n = 5; 17%), New Zealand ( n = 2; 6%), and Australia ( n = 2; 6%). There was one  41 
 
study from each of the following countries: Germany (3%), Canada (3%), Italy (3%), and 
Ireland (3%). Lastly, there was one study (3%) which recruited participants internationally with the sample representing 11 countries (including Australia, USA, Poland, Switzerland, Malta, Sweden, and Singapore; other countries not listed).  
Attrition  
Mindfulness research is known for its high dropout rate by participants according to 
Nam and Toneatto (2016), and the studies included in this review confirmed this trend. 48% (n = 14) of studies had an attrition rate of 26%-50%, 20% ( n = 6) had an attrition rate of 16%-
25%, 13% ( n = 4) of studies had 3%- 15%, 6% ( n = 2) of studies demonstrated small attrition 
rates (0% -2%), and 3% ( n = 1) had an attrition rate of 51% and higher. Lastly, two articles 
did not report their attriti on rate.   
Adherence  
Concerning studies that asked participants to meditate a specific amount (e.g., 10 
minutes daily), 27% ( n = 8) of studies had a 0% adherence rate, 6% ( n = 2) had 13% 
adherence rate, 6% ( n = 2) had 22%-24% adherence rate, 3% ( n = 1) of studies had a 39%-
46% adherence rate, 3% ( n = 1) of studies had a 61%-70% adherence rate, 3% ( n = 1) of 
studies had a 87%-120% adherence rate, and 6% ( n = 2) of studies had a 100% adherence 
rate. Six (20%) other studies adherence rates were based on if their participants used the application at all instead of doing a specific duration of meditation. One (3%) of which, found that the adherence was greater for its university sample depending on when in the semester the students took part in the study  (i.e., earlier in the semester; 66.10% vs 44.40% 
adherence). Adherence rate for the remaining studies consisted of the following: 6% ( n = 2) 
of studies had an adherence rate of 95%-100%, 3% ( n = 1) of studies had an adherence rate of 
72%, 6% ( n = 2) of st udies had an adherence rate of 55% -60%, and 20% ( n = 6) of studies 
did not report the adherence rate.   42 
 
Research Findings  
Research Question 1: What benefits are associated with the use of mindfulness- based apps 
for clinical and general population adults with respect to stress, symptoms of anxiety, and 
symptoms of depression?  
Anxiety. There were 10 (34%) articles that assessed for changes in the anxiety levels 
of their participants. Regarding studies that used Headspace ( n = 5; 50%), all of these studies 
(n = 5; 100%) found a significant effect in reducing anxiety. Concerning studies that used the 
Calm application (n = 3; 30%), 60% ( n = 2) found that users of the application self -reported 
significantly less anxiety than those in the control group whi le 30% did not ( n = 1). 30% ( n 
=1) of these studies found a small effect size. Regarding other applications used ( n = 2; 20%), 
one study used the Mindfulness Coach application and found that (a) anxiety symptoms 
significantly decreased as the study weeks i ncreased and (b) the more time spent using the 
application, the greater the association between decreases in symptoms of anxiety. The other 
study used the Stop Breathe & Think application, which did not find a significant difference 
in anxiety between the control and experimental group. 
Depression.  Overall, eighteen studies were assessed for changes in depressive 
symptoms (e.g., depression and negative affect) in their participants. 55% ( n =10) of studies 
found significant reductions in the depressive sympt oms of its participants, 33% ( n =6) did 
not find statistically significant reductions in depressive symptoms, and 11% of studies found 
mixed results ( n = 2; i.e., two groups used a mindfulness application but only one was found 
to have statistically significant decreases in depressive symptoms).  
Concerning Headspace, 76% ( n = 13) of the studies used the application. 69% ( n = 9) 
of such studies found that using Headspace resulted in statistically significant reductions in depressive symptoms. 7% of studies ( n = 1) found that the Headspace and gradual -muscle-
relaxation interventions were equally effective in reducing depression. 7% of studies (n = 1)  43 
 
found significant reductions in depressive symptoms when participants were using either 
Headspace or Smiling M ind, but the changes were only maintained in Smiling Mind at the 
final time point (i.e., 40 days). A significant reduction in depression, along with a medium effect size, was found in 14% ( n = 2) of studies. Furthermore, one of these studies found that 
the medium effect size persisted into the four month follow up. 7% ( n = 1) of studies found 
that depression was significantly reduced, with a small effect size.  14% ( n = 2) of studies had 
mixed findings, in which one group experienced benefits in depression while the other did 
not (both groups used the Headspace application). There were 21%  
(n = 3) of studies that found no change in depressive symptoms. One of these studies noted a 
reduction in negative affect as well as a small -medium effect size but it was not statistically 
significant.  
Regarding studies that used Calm ( n = 3; 16%), 66% ( n = 2) of such studies found 
significant reductions in depressive symptoms and one of these studies reported a small effect 
size. 33% ( n = 1) of studies did not find a statistically significant decrease in depressive 
symptoms but found a small- to-medium effect size.  
Of the 14% ( n = 3) of studies that used other applications, 33% ( n = 1) used Stop 
Breathe & Think and did not find a significant difference between the control group and 
experimental group both during the intervention phase nor at follow-up. 33% ( n = 1) of these 
studies utilized Mindfulness Coach and found that depressive symptoms within the intervention group significantly improved as the study’s weeks and time spent using the application continued. As mentioned previously, the other 33% ( n = 1) of studies had 
participants who were using either Headspace or Smiling Mind, and significant reductions in depression were found but the changes were only maintained in Smiling Mind at the final time point (i.e., 40 days).  44 
 
Stress.  Twenty -one studies (72%) assessed changes in the stress levels of their 
participants, and 14% ( n = 3) of these studies used devices to measure physiological changes 
in stress levels.  80% ( n = 17) of the studies found significant reductions in the perceived 
stress or physiological measurements of stress of their participants, while 14% ( n = 3) did not 
find a significant decrease in perceived stress. 4% ( n = 1) of studies found mixed results, due 
to having two groups that used the application but only one group experiencing a reduction in 
perceived stress.   
Concerning Calm, two (9%) studies used the application, and both of them found a 
significant reduction in per ceived stress. Additionally, one of them demonstrated a large 
effect size and the other showed a moderate effect size.  
The majority of the studies used Headspace (61% of studies; n = 13) and 76% ( n = 
10) of these studies found a significant reduction in pe rceived stress or physiological 
measurements of stress. Only 7% ( n = 1) of these studies measured physiological changes in 
stress. Moreover, 16% ( n = 2) of studies found no beneficial effect, and 8% ( n = 1) found 
mixed results. Only 53% ( n = 7) of studies using Headspace reported effect sizes, wherein 
71% ( n = 5) found a small- to-medium effect size, and 28% ( n = 2) found a large effect size.  
Concerning other applications, 23% ( n  = 6) of the studies used applications besides 
Calm and Headspace. 83% ( n = 5) of these studies found significant reductions in their 
participants' self -reported or physiological stress. 60% ( n = 3) of the studies measured 
changes in stress through physiological devices (e.g., blood pressure monitors). 16% of these studies found no s ignificant reduction in perceived stress (n = 1). Only two studies reported 
their effect sizes.  One of the studies found large effect size for systolic blood pressure, 
medium- to-large effect size for diastolic blood pressure and low effect size on heart ra te. One 
study found a small- to-medium effect size.   45 
 
Research Question 2: Have mindfulness-based apps been found to enhance well-being for 
clinical and general population adults?  
Only 20% ( n = 6) of the included studies assessed for changes in well -being in their 
research participants, and all of them used the Headspace application. 83% ( n = 5) of such 
studies found increases in well -being in their participants, while 16% (n = 1) did not. Of the 
studies that reported their effect sizes ( n = 4), 50% ( n = 2) reported a small effect size, and 
50% ( n = 2) reported a medium effect size.  
Research Question 3: What limitations have been identified with respect to the use of meditation -based apps for clinical and general population adults?  
Nearly half of the studies indicated that they needed to have more diverse samples 
that were inclusive of the general population (n = 12; 41%). This was further elaborated in that researchers were worried that the re sults would not generalize to men since their samples 
consisted of either entirely or primarily women ( n = 5), being from the same culture or race 
(n = 4), to certain age groups ( n = 1) or non- English speakers ( n = 2). Another study 
speculated that its par ticipants, who were primarily older, highly educated female participants 
(i.e., over 60 years old), were not representative of the general older adult population due to multiple demographic factors as well as these participants familiarity or fluency in digital devices such as smartphones. One also reported that more research was needed to understand the dosage necessary for beneficial effects as well as the long -term sustainability of 
improvements in mindfulness application -based interventions. A couple studies also noted 
the need to include more objective measures to capture how much their participants were actually meditating due to it often being self- reported by the participants ( n = 2). One study 
used PMR as an active control group; however, there were concerns that the similarities 
between the two interventions could have impacted the results. Some studies noted concerns regarding the outcome measures they had chosen. For instance, one study found that the  46 
 
results of their study would be hard to compar e to the existing literature due to not being a 
global measure of stress. Another study stated that they were limited by not including 
objective measurements. A few studies expressed concern that their study was not long enough to see a significant reducti on in psychological symptoms ( n = 3). Other studies noted 
trends in which there was a significant effect early, but it was not maintained or may have plateaued ( n = 3). One study reported not having an active control group, which could have 
made it more di fficult to assess the changes in psychological variables during the mindfulness 
intervention via application period. A couple studies also noted that their participants began either not using the application as instructed or meditating without the app (e.g., learning how to meditate with the application and then meditating on their own; n = 2).  Results of Individual Study Quality Appraisal  
Of the 29 included studies, the most common classification rating given to the studies 
was strong ( n = 12; 41%) based on the Individual Study Quality Appraisal form (see 
Appendix C). This was followed by the exemplary rating ( n = 7; 24%). There were additional 
studies ( n = 9, 31%) that met criteria for the good/adequate classification and 3% ( n =1) of 
studies were classif ied as weak.

Chapter 4: Discussion  
Overview of the Review  
The systematic review was aimed at summarizing and synthesizing the research 
literature from 2009 -2021 on mindfulness- based mobile applications, as well as their benefits 
with respect to stress, symptoms of anxiety, depression, and well- being. Furthermore, the 
review sought to address the limitations of these applications. The discussion section will 
review the implications of these findings and their relevance to general and clinical 
population adults as well as directions for future research.   
Significan t Findings Concerning the Research Questions  
Research Question 1: What benefits are associated with the use of mindfulness-based apps 
for clinical and general population adults with respect to stress, symptoms of anxiety, and symptoms of depression?  
Anxiety. Of the 10 studies that measured anxiety, only two studies (20%) did not find 
a statistically significant reduction in anxiety symptoms.  The rest of the studies found 
significant decreases in the anxiety levels of their participants and effect sizes of small -to-
large were reported ( n = 8; 80%). Another study found that the Headspace and gradual-
muscle-relaxation interventions were equally effective in reducing anxiety. One study compared both Headspace and Smiling Mind and found that they both significantly reduced anxiety symptoms for college students, which was maintained at the final time point at 30 
days post- intervention (i.e., 30-day open period for participants to use the application without 
a recommended dosage). Future studies comparing applicati ons will help determine which 
applications are most effective.  
These promising results were even found with unique populations such as cancer 
patients and those who had experienced a traumatic injury. Two studies found significant 
reductions in anxiety for patients suffering from cancer based on reductions in their HADS  48 
 
scores, but this effect was not observed for their caregivers who used the Headspace 
application under the same conditions. Notably, one of the studies that did not find any significant cha nge in anxiety levels was conducted with a sample of adults who had 
experienced multisystem trauma. This potentially demonstrates a limitation for the use of mindfulness applications with this population and suggests that participants must be cognitively e ngaged enough to use them, which could apply to other populations as well (e.g., 
dementia patients). Future research in the acceptability and usability of mindfulness- based 
mobile applications with populations with cognitive difficulties will better establish for whom these interventions are appropriate.  
Two studies pointed towards a pattern in which greater reductions in anxiety were 
associated with longer use of the mindfulness application over time and more frequent meditations. Specifically, one study that used the Mindfulness Coach application found that the more time spent using the application, the greater the association between decreases in 
symptoms of anxiety. This study found that anxiety symptoms significantly decreased as the 
study weeks increa sed, which was unique since it was carried out before the pandemic began 
and then ended while the pandemic was still ongoing. In another study that found a large 
effect size, the average participant completed 17 meditation sessions and results further indicated that if participants meditated for 10 sessions or more that there was a significantly 
higher likelihood of their anxiety symptoms improving. Although this seems promising, future research aimed at differentiating between different amounts of dosage w ill help better 
understand the minimum dosage necessary to alleviate anxiety. The implications of these findings suggest that there is strong evidence that mindfulness applications can alleviate symptoms of anxiety due to the majority of the studies findin g significant reductions in their 
participants. However, clinicians should be mindful that the majority of these articles used the Headspace application.   49 
 
Depression.  More than half of the studies measuring changes in the depression levels 
of its participan ts found significant reductions ( n = 10; 55%). A third  of the studies ( n = 6; 
33%) found no statistically significant reduction in depression. Notably, some studies found 
mixed results ( n = 2; 11%).  
Most of the studies involving Headspace found significant reductions in depressive  
symptoms in their participants ( n = 14; 72%). Concerning the Headspace application, 6% of 
studies found that the Headspace and gradual -muscle- relaxation participants were equally 
effective in reducing depression. 6% of studies found significant reductions in depressive 
symptoms with both Headspace and Smiling Mind, but the changes were only maintained in Smiling Mind at the final time point (i.e., 40 days). 6% of studies found that depression was significantly reduced, with a small effect size. There were 21% of studies, however, that found no change in depressive symptoms.  
There were only two studies using Calm (11%) and 50% found a significant reduction 
in depressive symptoms while the other 50% did not. The other applications featured were mixed in their results. A study using Stop Breathe & Think did not find a significant difference between the control group and experimental group (i.e., Stop Breathe & Think group) both during the intervention phase nor at follow-up. But the study utilizing Mindfulness Coach found that depressive symptoms within the intervention group improved as the study weeks and time spent using the application continued.  
Regarding unique populations, studies among cancer patients and caregivers were 
mixe d. One study found that cancer patients who used the Headspace application did not 
experience a statistically significant reduction in their depressive symptoms but that their caregivers did. Yet, a different study found the opposite, that their participants who were cancer patients experienced statistically greater improvements on their depression score in comparison to their caregivers. One study looked specifically at pregnant women suffering  50 
 
from depressive symptoms using Headspace and found that using the application was 
significantly associated with reduced depressive symptoms. A study involving anesthesia trainees found that the trainees' depression scores significantly decreased after one month of using Headspace and that the moderate effect size per sisted into the four month follow up. 
Lastly, in a study with female participants from Southern Louisiana, there was a statistically significant reduction in depressive symptoms but only 43 of the 318 participants used the Headspace application (13.5%). This study had one of the most diverse sample populations in the review so future research should continue to build upon including more diverse populations to discover the barriers they can experience when trying to use this intervention. In sum, there is st rong evidence that mindfulness applications are effective in reducing 
symptoms of depression but there may be more variables to consider regarding increasing their effectiveness such as total duration of the mindfulness application, different types of medi tations that are more targeted towards improving mood (e.g., meditations involving 
compassion, etc.) and making these applications more desirable and convenient for diverse 
populations who experience significant treatment barriers.  
Stress. Twenty -one stud ies assessed for changes in the stress levels of their 
participants (72%).  One study of German female university students found that both PMR 
and Headspace were comparable to each other in reducing stress. This could indicate future research to continue di recting comparing such interventions to identify advantages and 
disadvantages each has. The studies also demonstrated improvements in stress for caregivers of both loved ones with cancer and dementia ( n = 3; 14%). Future research concerning the 
dementia po pulation will help continue to determine if these applications are appropriate and 
beneficial for this population.  
Three studies used physiological changes to determine changes in stress levels. Of the 
studies that measured changes in stress based on physiological changes, results were  51 
 
encouraging ( n = 3; 14%). Overall, the studies found significant reductions in blood pressure, 
both systolic and diastolic, and that the participants with higher blood pressure entering the 
study tended to see the biggest ef fects. All these studies reported moderate to large effect 
sizes. Future studies assessing the effects of mindfulness applications with different physiological instruments will continue to aid in our understanding of the effects of mindfulness applications  to lower stress.  
Many of these studies featured unique populations and results overall were 
encouraging. Three studies were done with medical residents and found to significantly reduce stress which is important given the time constraints and level of re sponsibility these 
individuals have in their profession. In a study of patients who had suffered multisystem trauma, results indicated no significant reductions in stress scores, potentially identifying a limitation in who can use these applications. In a study with all women from Southern 
Louisiana, there was no significant change in stress levels in the group of women who chose 
to use the Headspace app. The authors contributed this to the fact that the women who used 
the app reported less stress upon ente ring the study which they speculated may suggest that 
those who need the app the most (i.e., very stressed individuals) require more outreach to 
encourage them to use the application. Another study found that its participants, who were pregnant women who s cored in the moderate to moderately severe level of depression per 
self-report on the PHQ -9, experienced a significant decrease in depressive symptoms when 
compared to baseline, at the 6 -week post -intervention follow up. The study that used the 
Mindfulness  You application found in their all African American sample that these 
participants experienced reductions in self -reported stress. This is especially important 
concerning diverse populations as this application was made specifically for African Americans who wanted to learn how to meditate.   52 
 
 Overall, these results suggest that mindfulness applications demonstrate excellent 
effectiveness in reducing both physiological and psychological symptoms of stress which 
indicates that these applications may not be beneficial for just mental health disorders but can also improve symptoms of medical conditions that are exacerbated or triggered by stress. Of notable significance, mindfulness applications often demonstrated moderate to large effect sizes which further su pport this conclusion.  
Research Question 2: Have mindfulness-based apps been found to enhance well-being for 
clinical and general population adults?  
 Well -Being. Only 20% ( n = 6) of the included studies assessed for changes in well -
being in their researc h participants and all of them used the Headspace application. Most of 
these studies (83%; n = 5) of these studies found increases in well -being in their participants, 
while 16% ( n = 1) did not. This indicates that mindfulness applications utilizing Headsp ace 
are effective in increasing well- being. However, despite the encouraging results there exists a 
clear need for more studies to be conducted assessing changes in well -being among 
individuals using mindfulness apps and for these studies to also assess th ese changes in other 
applications besides Headspace. Furthermore, future studies should specifically focus on measuring well -being as many of the included studies for this review claimed to study well-
being but would use distress or depression as a proxy for it. Should providers wish to suggest the use of these applications to improve the well -being of their clients, it is again 
recommended that they keep in mind that all the studies utilized the Headspace application so it is unclear if other mindfulness a pplications would produce similar outcomes.  
Research Question 3: What limitations have been identified with respect to the use of 
meditation -based apps for clinical and general population adults? 
 Clinical Population Adults. Certain populations did not appear to respond well to the 
mindfulness -based mobile applications for specific psychological symptoms. Studies  53 
 
involving adult multisystem trauma patients and myeloproliferative neoplasm patients were 
less likely to find reduc tions in symptoms of anxiety. It is therefore possible that certain 
populations, especially those suffering from serious or life- threatening medical conditions 
may not experience reductions in anxiety that would typically be found in the general 
population. One study involving pregnant women suffering from moderate -to-moderately -
severe antenatal depressive symptoms, however, did find significant reductions in self-report 
measures for depression and stress. Due to the review not including participants with serious 
mental illness, studies with individuals with a mental health disorder were limited. Therefore, 
this limits the generalizability of these findings concerning clinical and inpatient populations. 
Future research that includes serious mental illness as  well as inpatient populations will help 
to determine if these applications are beneficial for those suffering from more debilitating and 
harder to treat mental health disorders.  
 General Population Adults. It was a recurrent theme that the majority of participants 
in a given study would experience difficulty either using the mindfulness application at all or 
not typically use it for more than 50% of the recommended time. Even though the users who 
did consistently utilize the mindfulness application genera lly experienced improvements in 
psychological symptoms such as anxiety, stress, depression and well- being, this is still a 
notable limitation. This ultimately suggests that it remains unclear how users of mindfulness 
applications can be further engaged to use the application consistently to maximize benefits. 
Furthermore, there appeared to be difficulties in using it consistently (e.g., daily), and it was 
not uncommon for the participants to use it for “short bursts” before not using it again for a 
period of time. The results of the review also suggested significant limitations regarding the 
generalizability of the studies to diverse populations due to the majority of participants being 
White, highly educated females. This was even further exacerbated by the  fact that none of 
the applications had versions in other languages, which thereby excluded any non-English  54 
 
speakers. Moreover, there have been concerns that mindfulness -based mobile applications are 
geared primarily towards White individuals due to lacking culturally diverse content. 
Additionally, only one of the studies considered the gender identity of its participants. There 
was also concern by the researchers that participants were not using the application correctly 
(i.e., not meditating in a quiet sp ace or alone). There was one study which found that a 
participant was meditating but not using the application when meditating, which led his data 
to not be counted for the purposes of that study. There were also observations of a potential 
plateau regarding the psychological benefits of these applications. This indicates that it is 
difficult for providers to suggest a set dosage when recommending these applications to 
clients and that there is an urgent need for more structure in clarity to maximize the potential 
effects of mindfulness applications. Lastly, there were concerns about the sample sizes of the 
studies due to the high attrition rate observed in this review. Future research that focuses on 
recruiting larger sample sizes will significantly aid res earch in better determining effect sizes 
of mindfulness interventions.  
Diversity  
It was a recurrent theme that many of the studies did not have a significant 
representation of minorities. Surprisingly, the majority of studies had predominantly female 
participants ( n = 20; 68%), which many of the studies listed as an area of limitation due to 
concerns of the generalizability of their results. Furthermore, these female participants also tended to be younger and Caucasian. Only four (13%) studies had a predom inantly male 
population. In fact, there were some ( n = 4; 13%) studies that had samples that were entirely 
female versus only one (3%) that was composed entirely of male participants. Of note, only one study accounted for individuals who identified as transgender or other gender identity which represents a crucial area of future research.   55 
 
Regarding race, there was one study in which the sample was not majority White (i.e., 
consisted entirely of African Americans). The other studies that had African American 
participants, had a participant percentage ranging from 1%- 31% of the total sample. Notably, 
there were three studies from New Zealand that included native populations such as the Māori or Pasifika and two studies that had Native Americans from the United States in their sample, but they only totaled <9 % of the total sample. Thirteen studies had participants who identified as Asian, and the sample range was between 2% -25% of the total sample for those 
studies. Six of the studies had participants who identified as Latino/a or Hispanic and the sample range was between 1.7% -15% for those stu dies. There were several studies that had 
participants who identified as biracial or multiracial, yet the majority of studies did not offer that as an option for participants to endorse and did not even have an “other” option. This is worrisome given the c hanging demographic of the United States. For instance, in studies 
conducted in New Zealand, 8% -13% of participants chose “other” when asked to identify 
their race. The authors of those studies speculated that this was because there was no biracial 
or mult iracial category. Future research that includes such demographic options will be 
critical in order to best capture individual’s self -identified race.  
This was also notable regarding language, as it was only used as an exclusion criteria 
for the studies ra ther than to learn more about the languages its participants spoke in order to 
potentially offer mindfulness based mobile applications in their native tongue. This was frequently mentioned as an area of future research, since most of the studies utilized applications that were only available in English. This is further supported by several studies 
describing concerns in their ability to recruit diverse populations if unable to provide the application in a non- English language.  
Related to this was the near complete lack of religious diversity within the included 
studies. There was only one study which collected information concerning the religious  56 
 
identification of its participants. This was particularly surprising given that mindfulness has 
strong roots in eastern cultures (Brazier, 2013) and could highly influence one’s receptibility 
to the practice. Half of the studies also did not report if their participants had any experience with mindfulness prior to the study. By not having information related to the participants' religion, it also makes it harder to determine how they possibly learned mindfulness. Future research that collects information on participants' religion and religious practice will help better clarify the effects of previous experience with mindfulness as well as receptivity of mindfulness to those of other religions (e.g., Christians, Muslims).  
Only a little more than a third of the total included studies had information pertaining 
to the marital status of its participants. This was surpris ing given the importance that 
marriage can have on one’s physical and mental health (Kiecolt -Glaser & Newton, 2001). 
The majority of studies had samples in which the overwhelming majority of the participants were married or partnered. Interestingly, the studies often did not separately define being 
married versus being in a relationship. There was only one study in which the majority of 
participants were single or never married. Given the high number of studies with students and 
residents, there was still a sizable minority of individuals who were single.  
As stated previously, the majority of the sample of the included studies consisted of 
younger adults. Studies with geriatric adults were significantly limited with only three studies having participants who were 65 years or older. Given that the majority of the sample population was either students or residents/trainees, it is not surprising that the geriatric population is not as represented in this research.  
Concerning education, most of the studies incl uded the education level of their 
participants and the majority of the studies had samples who had at least some years of college. Moreover, four of the studies’ participants were in college at the time of the study. Only one study had a sample in which the majority had less than a college degree which  57 
 
again signals a population that is lacking representation in this research. The participants 
represented a broad range of socioeconomic status, but the majority consisted of wealthier individuals (31% earned $50,000 or more).  
Many researchers voiced concern over their reported sample and it is clear that there 
needs to be future research that includes more diverse individuals to better determine if mindfulness interventions via smartphone apps can be applied c ross-culturally. This is 
especially warranted given transgender and other gender identifying individuals as there was only one study that even took this population into account when collecting demographic data.  Furthermore, the research is lacking participants from different avenues of life (e.g., trade school, older adults, non -college educated individuals). Ultimately, t his suggests that it still 
remains unclear how well mindfulness applications  work with diverse and underrepresented populations. Attrit ion and Adherence  
Most of the studies had an attrition rate of 26% or more with nearly a third of the 
studies having attrition rates ranging from 0% -15%. Notably, one study that had an attrition 
rate of 2% was because a participant decided to meditate with out the app; however, this was 
an isolated phenomenon that was not found in the other studies. This indicates potential problems in the dispersal of mindfulness -based mobile applications as an intervention. If a 
quarter to half of participants will typical ly stop using the application, this begs the question 
of how well this kind of intervention would be received in the general community. One of the most common reasons for dropping out included not having time or being too busy. This is ironic given that much of mindfulness research has been aimed at targeting such individuals to help teach them better ways to cope with stressors associated with this kind of lifestyle (Berthon & Pitt, 2019).   58 
 
Adherence, likewise, also suffered due to only two studies having 100% adherence. In 
fact, it was common for participants to adhere either 24% of the time or less regarding the 
dosage of mindfulness that they were advised to engage in by the researchers. This also highlights the need for future research to be directed to wards increasing application usage to 
better encourage and engage the participants. There were four studies in which at least 27% of the participants in the intervention group never used the mindfulness app. Mindfulness research has long been plagued with low adherence rates by its participants (Baydoun, et al., 
2021), and this is a crucial area in need of improvement. If practitioners are to give mindfulness apps to their patients as adjunct treatments, it is critical that this is done in a way that is lik ely for the patient to engage in the recommended dosage to receive the maximum 
clinical benefit possible.  
Meditation Duration and Frequency  
Of the studies who requested participants to meditate for a certain duration, the most 
popular duration requested w as 10 minutes. Not surprisingly, the studies that gave 
participants a meditation regimen generally had participants who meditated more, and therefore received more psychological benefits such as reductions in anxiety, depression, or stress. Of note, several studies that did not find a significant effect for the psychological symptoms they were measuring, speculated that this was potentially due to the overall short length of the study (e.g., 2- 4 weeks). Some of the more robust decreases in stress (both self -
report and physiological) were found in studies that asked its participants to meditate several times a day (e.g., twice daily) and for longer durations (e.g., 15 minutes). Although the participants in the more demanding groups did experience a lower adhe rence rate over time, 
their results were often the most pronounced during the beginning of the study (i.e., first month). Furthermore, many participants of the studies typically practiced half the recommended dosage of mindfulness by the researchers ( n = 1 2). There did appear to be a  59 
 
“sweet spot” regarding what participants gravitated towards in terms of a mindfulness 
practice, as the majority of studies had participants who practiced mindfulness at least 1 -2 
times per week ( n = 17).  
Of the studies that did not instruct their participants to meditate a certain amount on a 
daily or weekly basis, they typically showed less progress in reducing psychological symptoms pertaining to this review. Some studies did ask participants to do a course (e.g., “Take Ten” program in which one meditates 10 minutes daily for 10 days on Headspace) and 
these results demonstrated good adherence rates. This likely signals that meditation courses may be easier for some individuals to follow due to the inherent structure and convenience of doing a meditation course (e.g., following a guided meditation rather than choosing a specific meditation). Calm tended to have shorter study durations (4- 8 weeks); whereas, Headspace 
had studies that typically continued for 10-  24 weeks. This could be an important reason for 
why studies using Headspace consistently found improvements in the psychological variables 
pertaining to this review (i.e., anxiety, depression, stress, and well -being). Future research 
should examine the effects of varying we eks of duration to better understand the minimum 
duration of meditation needed for reduction in mental health symptoms.  
Notably, several of the articles found that meditation duration and frequency did 
impact decreases with anxiety, depression, and stress. Although this review found that 
meditating for 10 minutes several times a week is associated with benefits in stress, anxiety, depression and well -being, there is still not enough research to determine a minimum dosage. 
This demonstrates that clinicians who advise their patients to use these applications should be familiar with the research regarding the minimum dosage to receive clinical benefits.  
Applications Utilized  
A surprising finding of the review was that the popular app “10% Happier” utilized 
significant components of CBT which led it to be excluded from this study (Ten Percent  60 
 
Happier, n.d.). The majority of the applications in the included studies were from Headspace, 
and given the economics involved, this is not surprising. Currently, Headspace is valued at $3 billion dollars (Anand, 2021), and this has likely allowed it to conduct more research and better quality research than its competitors. Calm has been financially successful and is valued at $2 billion dollars (Wilhelm & Mascarenhas, 2020), which further explains its significant presence in this research. Moreover, given the fact that the other applications had only one study each on average, this suggests that they were unable to partition enough money to engage in research to demonstrate the efficacy of their application. Given that many of the applications were only featured in one study for this review, it is still too early for any conclusions to be made about their effectiveness. This indicates that the current pool of studies is comp rised primarily of certain mindfulness applications that have the necessary 
funds to complete research, and this could lead them to be favored over other applications that do not have the ability to conduct their own research. Therefore, future research should 
focus on including a more diverse array of mindfulness applications, especially those that do 
not have large budgets, to enhance our existing knowledge of the benefits  and limitations of these applications.   
Research Designs Utilized  
The majority of studies utilized a randomized control trial (RCT; n = 15; 51%), which 
split participants into the intervention group and either the control or active control group. Concerns were frequently noted by the researchers concerning an appropriate active control group, as most of the RCTs that compared a mindfulness-based mobile application with PMR did not find a significant difference between the two groups. The second most common research designs were pilot studies ( n = 3; 10%). In sum, this indicates that the  research 
designs for the included studies are strong due to the randomization component of RCTs and the many other benefits they confer. Implications of this are that the included studies have  61 
 
strong research designs but that very few of them compared one  mindfulness application to 
the other and instead to a control group. Future research could continue to focus on 
developing more effective active -control groups as well as comparing mindfulness 
applications to each other.  Self-Report Measures Utilized  
Most of the studies utilized self -report measures that captured multiple symptoms. For 
this reason, the HADS, NIH PROMIS and PANAS measures were the most popular among the included studies. This is notable because these studies may not be used often at outpat ient 
clinics, but rather, in inpatient settings. Self- report measures such as the PHQ -4, PHQ -8 and 
BDI were used rather infrequently across the studies, and this is a potential limitation as more sensitive self -report measures could possibly capture sympto m changes better. The 
measurement of stress was also notable in that some of the studies used physiological measurements to determine if there were changes in stress levels. This highlights an 
important area of future research as receiving objective and im mediate feedback about one’s 
physiological state could help improve the delivery of mindfulness -based mobile 
interventions. Moreover, using more sensitive self -report measures (e.g., BDI -2, PHQ -9) 
would be an important avenue for future research, as this w ould allow greater specificity in 
documenting changes in psychological symptoms.  
Potential Conflicts of Interest  
Regarding studies that reported potential conflicts of interest, Calm studies were most 
likely to report potential conflicts of interest. This was notable as there were often authors present on these studies who were employed by Calm. One such author is ac tually the current 
Director of Science at Calm. Furthermore, some of these studies mentioned that the research was being done “in collaboration with Calm,” but the details of this collaboration were not entirely clear. Kaiser Permanente now offers its memb ers Calm for free as part of being a  62 
 
member, which likewise raises suspicions about studies done at Kaiser Permanente using the 
Calm application. Despite such disclaimers assuring that there was no financial support for the research, authorship, and public ation of the study, this does suggest that the results of 
these studies may need to be taken cautiously. Likewise, there are concerns about research conducted using Headspace, since Headspace often provided study authors and participants free subscriptions or trials of the Headspace application. Some studies using Headspace mentioned that the Headspace research team provided assistance, but they denied letting those researchers have any control over the data or input into the design, analysis, or reporting of the study. Similar to studies utilizing Calm, some studies involving Headspace had authors who worked at Headspace, but this was reported as a conflict of interest. Notably, there were some studies in which there was no disclaimer declaring or denying a  conflict of 
interest which was notably worrisome. The implications for this are considerable in that there is a need for more independent research to confirm these findings and that providers should 
be aware of the economic incentives of these companies w hen assessing the research of these 
mindfulness applications. Future research should include more studies in which the ties 
between the researchers and the mindfulness application companies are limited or nonexistent in order to reduce potential bias.  
COV ID-19 
Some of the studies were conducted during the COVID -19 pandemic and 
demonstrated significant effects in reducing psychological distress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms (none of these studies measured changes in well -being). Importantly, they were 
deemed to be convenient, feasible, and effective interventions given that many of the participants were vulnerable to infection from COVID -19 and even more vulnerable to 
suffering from complications (e.g., cancer patients with diminished immune systems). Th is 
implies that mindfulness applications could be an important intervention for at risk  63 
 
populations or those who experience treatment barriers including transportation issues or lack 
of time to commute. Future research should aim at measuring the effective ness of these 
applications during future lockdowns and quarantines due to the probable likelihood that such events will reoccur.  
Limitations  
 Although this review provided some much- needed direction concerning the efficacy 
of mindfulness -based mobile apps, there remain important questions regarding their use. 
Given that only a subset of available academic databases was searched, it is possible t hat 
some relevant publications on mindfulness -based mobile applications were missed. The 
inclusionary criteria employed also resulted in the omission of studies of mindfulness applications developed exclusively for desktop, laptop, or tablet computers, those designed only for non -English speakers, and those available outside of platforms such as iOS and 
Android. Future research involving the inclusion of this technology could aid in better 
understanding the benefits and limitations of mindfulness interventi ons being delivered via 
newer technological equipment. Most notably, perhaps, the fact that only a small fraction of 
available mindfulness -based apps have been subjected to empirical study inevitably means 
that the results of this review were based only on  a small subset of extant mindfulness -based 
apps, making the generalizability of the results to all such apps uncertain.  
Additionally, this study did not assess where people were using the applications, 
which is important given the potential impact of the  environment (i.e., in a silent or noisy 
environment) on the efficacy of the mindfulness intervention being delivered through a mobile device. It was also beyond the scope of this research to assess for application variables concerning the efficacy of the mobile mindfulness -based application. Therefore, 
there is little in the way of determining application preference based on efficacy. Future  64 
 
research aimed at comparing the efficacy of these applications will be crucial in helping 
inform consumers on which application is most appropriate for their needs.  
 Concerning psychological variables, the role of anxiety, depression, stress (self -report 
and physiological), and well -being were explored in this review. However, there was no 
examination of the role of trauma symptoms such as those found in PTSD. Given that mindfulness interventions have become popular within populations that are at a higher risk of developing PTSD such as first responders and those in the military (Chopko et al., 2018; Gallegos, et al., 2015; Kline et al., 2016), this is a notable limitation of the review. The review also did not assess how these applications were used in inpatient settings and in those with psychotic symptoms/disorders. Therefore, it is unclear how effective these applica tions 
are in populations suffering from serious mental illness. Lastly, the review did not assess psychological variables pertaining to substance use, making it unclear how effective these applications are for the treatment of addiction. Future research co ncerning these 
psychological variables will significantly improve our understanding concerning the efficacy 
of these applications with patients suffering from serious mental illness and those residing in inpatient settings.  
Future Directions  
As previously stated, there are multiple avenues to explore concerning the 
improvement and future role of mindfulness -based mobile applications in reducing 
psychological symptoms and suffering. Comprehensive studies that consider the variables of existing applications (e.g., gamification and feasibility of applications) and evaluate them 
based on personal efficacy remain a promising area of research, as this will allow consumers and treatment professionals to determine which applications hold the most promise for mental health treatment and to be informed as to why they are more effective than other mindfulness applications.   65 
 
Most of all, there continue to be many questions regarding the dosage of meditation to 
receive its multiple benefits and there continues to be a ne ed for research to be conducted that 
better assesses the minimum dose necessary for alleviating psychological symptoms. 
Additionally, future studies that measure the duration of these reductions to determine how long they are maintained post -intervention w ould contribute greatly to the literature. 
Moreover, there exist various types of meditation which could potentially have more specific uses concerning alleviating psychological distress. Given that many treatment providers desire to include mindfulness -based mobile applications into treatment or refer such 
applications to their patients as adjunctive treatment, future research could look at how well these applications do in either aiding treatment or being used as a separate intervention outside of session . Furthermore, future research pertaining to the application variables 
concerning efficacy of these applications will greatly strengthen our understanding of what  
makes a suitable application for the delivery of mindfulness interventions.  
Notably, this re view focused on how well mindfulness can be delivered through a 
specific technological manner (i.e., mobile devices); however, it is unclear if there are any benefits or limitations regarding the delivery of mindfulness through other technologies such as tablets, virtual reality, laptops, and so on. This will likely become more relevant as 
additional technology is introduced to deliver mindfulness interventions. Therefore, future research assessing application variables and the ideal environment for them to  be used will 
significantly aid in our understanding regarding how to best enhance their effectiveness. The mindfulness -based mobile applications that were selected in this study purposely excluded 
apps that incorporated significant components of therapeut ic modalities in order to better 
assess the efficacy of the mindfulness applications. Therefore, due to not having specific protocols as is common in evidenced -based treatments, a promising future avenue of research 
could be to study the effectiveness of m indfulness -based mobile applications that utilize  66 
 
evidenced -based treatments that include mindfulness as a core component of their modality 
such as MBCT, dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT), and ACT, to name a few. This is 
potentially on the horizon, as H eadspace in January 2022 acquired Sayana, a self -care 
application that utilizes mood trackers, sleep sessions, check -ins, breathing exercises and 
exercises with components of treatment modalities such as CBT, ACT and DBT (Landi, 2022). Furthermore, Headspa ce acquired Ginger, an online mental health service that utilizes 
smartphone -based technology and services such as therapy, behavioral health coaching, 
medication evaluations with psychiatry and self -care resources (Landi, 2021). In fact, other 
application s such as Anxiety Solution & Relief based on Chloe Brotheridge’s book The 
Anxiety Solution  already contain CBT techniques, mood tracking and journaling (Psyt, 2019). 
Moreover, given the potential change in preference concerning the technological delivery of mindfulness interventions, it will likewise be helpful to conduct research assessing the delivery of these applications through other forms of technology such as VR.  
Lastly, given the significant economics involved in this research, a compelling case 
can be made that there needs to be a way for other application companies that lack appropriate funding to conduct research. This is a highly important avenue concerning future research due to certain companies being able to dominate the market, particularly high -
earning companies, simply by being one of the few that can devote money to research. If the majority of mindfulness application companies are unable to afford conducting research this could significantly delay the future of this kind of research.  
Conclusion  
This systematic review sought to address the effectiveness of mindfulness -based mobile 
applications to improve common psychological symptoms (i.e., anxiety, depression, stress and well -being). Mindfulness -based mobile applications have demonstrated effectiveness in 
reducing common psychological symptoms such as anxiety, depression, perceived stress (as  67 
 
well as physiological markers of stress) and improving well -being. Research is still needed to 
further improve their usability and feasibility as wel l as compare differences between 
mindfulness applications. Moreover, future research determining the proper duration and 
frequency of utilizing mindfulness -based mobile applications to improve psychological 
symptoms would greatly benefit the field. Likewis e, it is highly warranted that future studies 
include more diverse populations regarding gender, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status and religion. Given that mindfulness -based mobile applications are widely available to the 
general public and have been s hown to be effective for a variety of adult populations as is 
indicated by this review, they represent a promising intervention that could be used by many in both the general and clinical adult population.

Informal Caregivers  single -arm pilot 
study  Reduced 
distress  Further engage clinical staff to maximize enrollment. A 
brief introductory conversation with participants about the 
benefits of stress reduction and/or an introduction to the 
program to increase p atient engagement. Continue to 
involve caregivers, and investigate how to increase the 
enrollment, adherence, and completion rates among 
understudied  populations. Offer the intervention in 
languages other than English to improve minority 
population partici pation.  
Noone & 
Hogan, 2018  91 University Students  RCT  No reductions

diverse participants.  
Include a control population.  
Economides 
et al., 2018  59 General Population Adults  RCT  Reductions in 
stress and 
negative affect  Use global measures of stress to compare this result to the 
existing literature. Longer intervention period.  
Champion et 
al., 2018  74 General Population Adults  RCT  Reduction in 
stress  Recruit larger samples. Use active control groups. 
Investigate the impact of app -based MM training in more 
diverse, less biased study populations.  
Bostock et 
al., 2019  238 Employees of a High -Tech 
Company or Pharmaceutical 
Firm  RCT   Improved well -
being and 
decreased 
distress  Explore potential mechanisms of workplace mindfulness 
trainings and tailor interventions to target those 
mechanisms. Examine whether these improvements can 
be sustained over time and, if so, whether mindfulness 
meditation practiced via mobile app improves long -term 
psychological and physical health. Recruit participants 
based on high levels of work stress or BP, as that would 
leave more room for the intervention to change those 
outcomes. Compare app -based delivery of mindfulness 
training with traditional group -based delivery, as well as 
compare mindfulness with other scalable stre ss-reduction 
techniques (e.g., lunchtime park walks).

symptoms  Clarify if mindfulness intervention requires a higher level 
of effort for individuals than the gradual muscle relaxation 
intervention.  
Flett et al., 
2019  210 University Students  RCT  Reductions in 
anxiety and 
depressive 
symptoms.  Use more conservative effect size estimates when 
conducting th eir power analyses. Design protocol to 
collect objective measures of app usage. Collect more 
objective behavioral  measures to support their self -
reported measures. Investigate mindfulness -based apps as 
standalone vs. adjunct -to-treatment as usual. Compare 
mindfulness -based apps to not only established 
mindfulness meditation programs but also to active app -
based controls.
