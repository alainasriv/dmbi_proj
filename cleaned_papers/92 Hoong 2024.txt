RESULTS
The COVID-19 pandemic has placed enormous stress 
and demand on HCWs. This has led to an increased 
need for mental health promotion programmes to 
support the well-being of these workers. The mental 
state of healthcare professionals at the front lines of 
this pandemic has been examined. Fifty articles were 
potentially eligible for further consideration, but only 8 
articles provided information that answered the research 
questions.  The studies mainly concluded that mental 
health interventions programmes effectively reduced 
psychological symptoms in HCWs during the COVID-19 
pandemic. Findings from previous literature on the 
efficacy of mental health promotion programmes for 
HCWs during the COVID-19 are summarised as follows:
Participant Characteristics:  HCWs in various settings 
and roles, including physicians, nurses, and support staff, 
were the primary participants in the studies reviewed.
Intervention Characteristics:  The interventions reviewed 
were primarily digital and included mindfulness-based 
programmes, psychological resilience programmes, 
e-healthcare interventions, and self-help psychological 
interventions. Some studies involved video consultations, 
while others used online platforms or self-help resources.
Outcomes:  The studies showed that mental health 
promotion programmes could positively impact HCWs’ well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic. Outcomes 
included reduced symptoms of anxiety and depression, 
improved psychological resilience, and enhanced 
overall well-being (20). However, despite the positive 
findings, the studies had limitations such as small sample 
sizes, lack of generalisability to other populations and 
settings, and limited long-term follow-up.
Multiple studies have examined the efficacy of 
psychological health promotion initiatives for HCWs 
during the pandemic. These programs have included 
psychological resilience interventions, mindfulness-
based programmes, and e-health interventions (21). 
Previous studies indicate that mental health promotion 
programmes effectively improve HCWs’ well-being 
during the COVID-19 pandemic. These programmes 
have been shown to lower anxiety and depression 
symptoms and enhance resilience and mindfulness. 
E-health interventions are particularly effective in 
improving mental health due to their accessibility 
and convenience (22). Furthermore, there is evidence 
that mental health promotion programmes are also 
beneficial in preventing mental health disorders among 
HCWs during the pandemic. A randomised controlled 
trial by WHO concluded that a self-help psychological 
interventional programmes effectively prevented mental 
disorders (23).
This pandemic has profoundly impacted the mental 
health of HCWs, who have been at the forefront of 
responding to the pandemic. Studies have shown that 
HCWs are at a greater risk of acquiring mental health 
issues, such as anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic 
stress disorder (PTSD) (24). As a result, several mental 
health promotion programmes have been implemented 
for HCWs (24, 25). A literature review on the efficiency 
of these initiatives showed that various interventions had 
been used, including mindfulness-based programmes, 
self-help, and online-based interventions. These 
interventions effectively improve the mental health of 
HCWs, including decreasing anxiety, depression, and 
PTSD symptoms (26).
In addition, the analysis indicated that online-based 
therapies are particularly effective in enhancing the 
mental health of HCWs, as they allow for easy access to 
mental health resources and can be delivered at scale. 
Moreover, online-based interventions also offer HCWs 
greater anonymity and privacy, which is vital for those 
concerned about stigma and its impact on their careers 
(27). WHO self-help psychotherapy prevented mental 
disorders among Syrian refugees in Turkey. Another 
study found that mindfulness-based interventions 
effectively improved HCWs’ mental health during the 
COVID-19 (28).
Finally, the current evidence supports effectiveness of 
mental health promotion programmes for healthcare 
workers during the pandemic. These programs effectively  Mal J Med Health Sci 20(2): 285-292, March 2024 289Malaysian Journal of Medicine and Health Sciences (eISSN 2636-9346)
improve the well-being of HCWs and can help prevent 
mental health disorders. Therefore, organisations 
and governments must prioritise the mental health of 
HCWs and provide access to effective mental health 
promotion programmes (27, 29). Overall, the findings 
of this systematic review suggest that mental health 
promotional programs for HCWs during the pandemic 
can effectively enhance the mental well-being of HCWs. 
However, further research is needed to determine 
the most effective strategies for implementing these 
programmes and to understand how they can be scaled 
up to reach a more significant number of HCWs. 
DISCUSSION
The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a worldwide 
health catastrophe that has had a substantial effect on 
the mental health of HCWs. According to extensive 
demographic research and relevant community 
samples, the COVID-19 outbreak was linked to a 
higher incidence of mental health issues in the overall 
population. The stress and emotional strain of dealing 
with the pandemic have increased anxiety, depression, 
and burnout among HCWs. To address this issue, mental 
health promotion programmes have been implemented 
to support the well-being of HCWs during this difficult 
time. A systematic review was conducted to assess the 
effectiveness of these programmes (30).
The review found that various interventions were used 
to promote mental health among HCWs, including 
mindfulness-based programmes, digital mental health 
interventions, and self-help psychological interventions. 
Many of these strategies were shown to be beneficial 
in minimising anxiety and depression symptoms and 
enhancing mental health among HCWs (31).
The stress and anxiety related to exposure to the virus, 
long work hours, and the added pressure of providing care 
in unprecedented circumstances have led to increased 
mental health problems among HCWs. In most contexts, 
psychiatrists mainly offer psychological therapies to 
other HCWs and the general public. Psychiatrists as 
HCWs may be susceptible to mental health conditions, 
given the emotional impacts of the outbreak and the 
rising need for mental health services. (9, 32) The state 
of psychiatric HCWs’ psychological health is poorly 
understood. This is perhaps because psychiatric HCWs 
are thought to be mentally solid individuals who must 
have the required skills and knowledge to manage the 
pandemic’s psychological consequences. The abilities 
of psychiatric HCWs to address the growing number of 
individuals experiencing psychological distress due to 
the outbreak will be significantly impacted by a high 
degree of undiagnosed anxiety and despair (33).
In the context of mental health issues severity, the 
psychological programmes for healthcare professionals 
address the demands of mental health services and help employees deal with anxiety and depression during 
the pandemic. (34) Because HCWs are still a core part 
of the staff assisting the public health approach to the 
COVID-19 pandemic, accurate and varied actions are 
required to help this population’s mental health. The 
development and implementation of initiatives to meet 
the mental health requirements of HCWs throughout this 
highly dynamic health crisis involve available evidence 
that gives a detailed knowledge of determinants of health 
(15). This indication must also be used to make effective 
interventions and priority-setting decisions (35).
Various mental health promotion programmes have been 
implemented to address these issues to support the well-
being of h HCWs during the pandemic (36). A review 
found that various interventions, such as psychological 
support, mindfulness-based programs, and digital mental 
health interventions, improved HCWs’ mental health 
during the pandemic. The interventions significantly 
improved in reducing stress, anxiety, and depression 
and promoting well-being among HCWs (37 – 39). 
The present study is a preliminary systematic review 
that explored evidence of mental health programmes’ 
effectiveness towards HCWs in empirical studies 
worldwide. The comprehensive nature of the evaluation 
was accomplished by the inclusion of a multitude of 
high-quality, peer-reviewed papers, which facilitated 
the formation of a dependable conclusion. The strategy 
was predicated on the authors’ prior understanding of 
the subject of the study, the conventional method of 
review, and specialised keywords.
However, it is essential to note that there were some 
limitations to the studies included in this systematic 
review. Many research, for example, had a limited 
number of participants, and some of the studies had a 
significant risk of bias. Meta-analysis was not conducted 
since the majority of the included studies had small 
sample sizes, and a few studies with weak response rates 
limited the generalizability of the findings. Variability 
in the instrument used, data collection and analysis 
methods, the notion of the effectiveness of mental health 
programmes, and the general study objective might 
account for the heterogeneity across studies, which 
limited comparisons. There is a mix of comparisons of 
different outcomes of the studies, which we considered 
not to combine too diverse outcomes. Nevertheless, 
despite these limitations, the systematic review findings 
suggest that mental health promotion programmes 
can effectively support HCWs’ well-being during the 
COVID-19 pandemic.
CONCLUSION
The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly influenced 
the mental health of HCWs worldwide. The increased 
stress and workload, along with the fear of contracting 
the virus, have resulted in high burnout and mental  Mal J Med Health Sci 20(2): 285-292, March 2024 290Malaysian Journal of Medicine and Health Sciences (eISSN 2636-9346)
distress among this population. In response, mental 
health promotion programmes have been introduced to 
support the well-being of HCWs. 
The systematic review’s findings indicate that mental 
health promotion initiatives may successfully enhance 
the mental well-being of HCWs during the pandemic. The 
most commonly used interventions were mindfulness-
based programmes, online-based interventions, and 
self-help psychological interventions. The programmes 
showed a positive effect on reducing anxiety and 
depression symptoms and improving overall well-being.
However, it is essential to note that the findings were 
based on limited studies, and further research is needed 
to fully understand these programs’ effectiveness. The 
systematic review also highlighted the importance of 
considering conflict of interest in evaluating certain 
apps and programmes.
In conclusion, mental health promotion initiatives may 
play an essential part in supporting the well-being of 
HCWs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, 
organisations and policymakers must invest in and 
implement such programmes to ensure the mental well-
being of HCWs at the forefront of responding to the 
pandemic. However, further research is needed to fully 
understand these programmes’ effectiveness and ensure 
they are based on best practices and evidence.
