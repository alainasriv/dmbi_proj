Characteristics of Included Studies
Out of the 15 publications that met the inclusion criteria for this
review [40,54-67], 10 (67%) studies were conducted in the
United States [40,54,56,58-61,63,66,67], with publication dates
ranging from 2016 to 2023. Overall, 13 (87%) of the 15 studies
focused on specif ic MHAs [54-61,63-67], including 2 MHA
prototypes [58,67]. Of the app-specif ic studies, 4 had a mixed
methods design [55,58,60,63], 7 were quantitati ve[54,56,57,59,61,65,67] and 2 were qualitati ve studies [64,66].
The last 2 studies did not focus on a specif ic MHA; instead,
they assessed preference for web-based help versus FTF mental
health help using surveys, both were quantitati ve [40,62]. Table

Purposes of Using MHAs in Racial and Ethnic
Minority Groups
The most common purpose for using MHAs was depression
(¡Aptí vate!, iPST [internet-based problem-solving therap y],
iBobbly , and a prototype app by McCall et al [58]) [54,56-58].
The iBobbly MHA also addressed impulsi vity; however, this
was not the main purpose of use.
Two studies focused on overall psychological well-being
[59,66]. The BRA VE app was used to promote overall mental
well-being by including help-seeking behaviors, general mental
health, and cultural resilience as outcome measures. Agapie et
al [66] included a mix of MHAs, with the aim of measuring
their effect on psychological well-being using qualitati ve
methods.
The other apps in this review had various purposes. The Build
Your Own Theme Song (BYOTS) app was aimed at reducing
anxiety and negative thoughts. The Sanadak app [65] aimed to
reduce posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, whereas
Mindful You [67] aimed to reduce stress.Inter vention Characteristics
A total of 20 apps were investig ated in this review; 8 MHAs
(including 2 prototypes) were included in 14 of the 15 studies
[54,56-59,63-67], whereas 1 study [66] included 12 self-help
MHAs that were qualitati vely investig ated.
Of the 20 apps, 8 (40%) were based on cogniti ve behavioral
therap y (CBT) [65,66] or variations of the CBT approach, such
as problem-solving therap y [56], acceptance-based therap y [57],
and behavioral activation therap y [54]. Five (25%) apps were
based on mindfulness [66,67], and the 7 (35%) apps could be
described as miscellaneous: the prototype by McCall et al [58],
which included the elements of CBT and psychotherap y [58];
the BYOTS app, which is based on musical cogniti ve
restructuring [63]; and the BRA VE app, which is based on
offering information and role model videos aimed at providing
coping skills [59]. The remaining 4 miscellaneous apps were
described as “wellness hacks” by Agapie et al [66]: Covid
Coach, Daylio, Moodflo w, and Talk Life. The full list of MHAs
categorized by therapeutic approach is shown in Textbox 1.

Consideration of Racial and Ethnic Minority Groups
While Developing MHAs
Of all the MHAs mentioned, 7 apps targeted racial and ethnic
minority groups specif ically: ¡Aptí vate!, iBobbly , BRA VE,
BYOTS, the prototype app by McCall et al [58], Sanadak, and
Mindful You. The inclusion of racial and ethnic minority groups
was ensured by codeveloping the app with the target population,
by using workshops [56], intervie ws [55,59], usability trials
[58], or working with culturally informed organizations [63].
¡Aptí vate! [54] was developed in Spanish language to be
acceptable to the Hispanic population. Both Sanadak and
Mindful You were developed with the specif ic needs of racial
and ethnic minority groups in mind and tailored to the type of
material used in the apps.
Examining the Acceptability of MHAs Among Racial
and Ethnic Minority Groups
To measure the acceptability of MHAs among racial and ethnic
minority groups, 8 studies referred to app use and interacti ve
data [54,56,57,59-61,65,67] in 6 MHAs. Studies reported good
adherence to the specif ied MHAs throughout the set duration
period in Hispanic, Aboriginal, Torres Strait Islander , and
American Indian and Alaska Native individuals. Adherencedata ranged from 81.8% to 91.2% of participants using and
interacting with the app.
For the ¡Aptí vate! app, participants were asked to use the app
within the 8 weeks provided. The retention rate was 100% in
the first week but decreased to 50% by the eighth week. This
study suggests that the 50% drop in retention can be explained
by the local versus remote recruitment of Latina participants.
Those who attended baseline visits in person were more likely
to use the app more frequently than those who did remotely .
Dahne et al [54] also reported that 50% of Hispanic participants
who continued using ¡Aptí vate! 2 months after enrollment
showed a high level of acceptability . Pratap et al [56] also
recruited Hispanic and Latina participants and conducted a
randomized controlled trial for 3 months to evaluate the iPST
app. Engagement and retention rates were assessed based on
the number of completed surveys. The study reported 34.4%
dropouts in the Hispanic and Latino population. Of those who
dropped out, more than half reported making ≤US $20,000
annually . Of those who used the app, Hispanic and Latina
participants showed a 50% decrease in engagement from week
1 to week 4. It is important to note that this is based on the
completion of the assessment and, therefore, is not an accurate
representation of app use.

RenderX The BRA VE app was also used in an 8-week trial [60], with an
overall retention rate of 87%. Among the participants in the
BRA VE arm, 41 American Indian and Alaska Native
participants opted out during the interv ention and 25 opted out
at crosso ver. This suggests a dropout rate of only 13% [59].
The iBobbly app was used by Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander participants in a 6-week trial. The app had the lowest
dropout rate (3%) of all other MHAs in this review. The study
argues that this was due to technical issues and speculated that
some participants might have felt self-conscious about sharing
their use data [57].
Sanadak was designed for Syrian participants, and they were
asked to use the app regularly for 4 weeks. The retention rate
was 87.2%, with a dropout rate of 12.8%, where most
participants refused to continue. Upon further analysis, Röhr et
al [65] claimed that there was no signif icant difference between
participants who completed the study and those who did not.
Finally , Watson-Singleton et al [67] explored the Mindful You
app. African American participants were asked to use the app
for 2 weeks. The study reported a dropout rate of 45%, which
the study found difficult to explain because the app was designed
specif ically for African Americans. Participants who continued
using the app felt positi ve about Mindful You, giving the app
4.38 stars out of 5.
Overall, dropout rates were signif icantly higher among Hispanic
and Latino participants than among non-Hispanic participants,
with the latter staying on average 18.5 days longer .
Qualitati ve studies measured the acceptability of MHAs using
intervie ws [55], workshops and focus groups [63], surveys
[40,62], and questionnaires [58].
Participants were intervie wed about the iBobbly app in terms
of acceptability , cultural appropriateness, and whether the app
provided help with their feelings and created distractions. The
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participants reported that
iBobbly was acceptable, especially in terms of accessibility .
Moreo ver, the participants felt a sense of privacy that was valued
more than talking with a therapist or a family member .
Participants also spok e of the “shame” attached to young
Aboriginal people when asking for help, and so the iBobbly
app was seen as culturally appropriate. Povey et al [64] also
explored the iBobbly app and compared it with a therapist-led
app. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participants showed
enthusiasm when they helped design the AIMhi- Y app [43].
Barnett et al [63] conducted focus groups regarding the BYOTS
app designed for Black and biracial girls, and they were
prompted to use the app 3 times a day for 1 week. This study
did not mention dropout rates. However, using focus groups,
the study showed that Black and biracial girls found the BYOTS
app acceptable and useful in daily situations.
Agapie et al [66] explored a variety of apps with Hispanic and
Latina participants. They were asked to use 1 app from each
category weekly for a 5-week period and then complete a focus
group at the end of each week. Every week participants would
use a different app and then the last week they chose their
favorite. There were no official use data; participants were asked
to report how often they used the app, and they were most likelyto report “a few days a week. ” It seems that mindfulness apps
were more acceptable, with 60% of participants reporting
continued use. During the focus groups, participants noted that
the apps were easy to use and accessible. However, the
participants generally preferred to use the apps with more free
content. Some participants reported concern about whether the
app was validated by professionals and expressed the need to
feel safe.
Both Lungu and Sun [40] and Malone y et al [62] used a
questionnaire to assess the acceptability of MHAs in general.
Of the 75.3% Asian American young adults who endorsed
seeking mental health help on the web, only 22% were interested
in MHAs [40]. Asian American participants were more likely
to be in the “No therap y” and “Online only” groups compared
with White participants. Similarly , 56% of the Jamaican
participants were interested in using MHAs. However, shame,
stigma, and embarrassment were reported to be the major
barriers to seeking help. However, using a questionnaire, McCall
et al [58] found that African American women reported that the
prototype app was easy to use and provided culturally helpful
information for anxiety and depression.
Overall, the apps were acceptable both quantitati vely through
use data and qualitati vely, as participants described their
engagement with and enthusiasm for the apps. However, dropout
rates among some racial and ethnic minority groups remain
high, and there is some discrepanc y in the measurement of
acceptability .
Examining the Effecti veness of MHAs With Racial
and Ethnic Minority Groups
Outcome Measures and Study Design
Nine of the 15 studies included in this review were quantitati ve
[40,54,56,57,59,61,62,65,67], 4 used mixed methods
[55,58,60,63], and 2 were qualitati ve [64,66].
In terms of quantitati ve studies, 3 studies [54,56,57] assessed
depression levels in Hispanic and Indigenous Australian
individuals. Two studies assessed mental health resilience in
American Indian and Alaska Native populations [59,61]. One
study assessed the levels of PTSD in Syrian refugees [65], and
the other focused on mindfulness in Black African Americans
[67]. The last 2 measured the recepti veness of web-based mental
health support and MHAs with Jamaican [62] and Asian
American [40] participants.
Four studies adopted mixed methods designs [55,58,60,63] and
assessed Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander , Black and
biracial, and Indigenous Australian population. Three of these
studies explored named MHAs: BRA VE [60], iBobbly [55],
and BYOTS [63]. The remaining was an unnamed app, and the
study explored its usability [58]. All studies, except for the one
by Stephens et al [60], used surveys [55,58,62,63] and focus
groups [63] or intervie ws [55,56] or cogniti ve walkthrough and
think-aloud methods [58]. Stephens et al [60] did not use any
measures, as they reported lessons learned from recruiting and
engaging participants from the previous BRA VE study [59].
Outcome measures that were used by Tighe et al [55] and Povey
et al [64] were appropriately translated to and validated in other

RenderX languages to suit the ethnicity of the sample. Surveys,
workshops, and intervie ws were developed and appro ved by
mental health professionals of the target ethnicity .
Finally , the 2 qualitati ve studies focused on measuring the
acceptability of the respecti ve MHAs and discussing barriers
to continued use [64,66]. All the outcome measures are
presented in Table 1.
Effectiveness
Studies that explored a specif ic app assessed its effectiveness
by using either weekly assessments [54,56,65] or pre- and
postinterv ention changes in outcome measure scores
[57,59,61,63,67]. Outcome measures were divided into clinical
outcomes (eg, depression, anxiety , and suicidality) and other
behavioral outcomes (eg, distress, resilience, and self-ef ficacy).
Quantitati ve studies on clinical outcomes that measured
effectiveness using weekly assessments had inconclusi ve results.
The ¡Aptí vate! app [54] reported signif icantly lower depressi ve
symptoms in Hispanic adults than in the no-treatment group;
however, depressi ve symptoms did not differ on average across
time between the 2 groups. Pratap et al [56] found impro vement
in depression scores among Hispanic and non-Hispanic
participants, regardless of the treatment arm and ethnicity .
However, they noted no evidence of any clinically meaningful
changes between the iPST and the control group. The authors
noted that only participants who reported severe depressi ve
symptoms showed the greatest decline; however, this only lasted
until week 4 of the study . Tighe et al [57] reported a decline in
depressi ve symptoms among Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander participants, but no signif icant reduction was observ ed
in the primary outcome of suicidality in Indigenous Australian
participants. In addition, no signif icant relationship between
use time and any of the outcome measures was observ ed. The
Sanadak app [65] also showed no signif icant differences in
PTSD symptoms between the interv ention and control groups
after 4 weeks and 4 months of follow-up.
Other behavioral outcomes were also explored by quantitati ve
studies. For instance, Pratap et al [56] explored functional
impairment in addition to depressi ve symptoms and found no
difference in disability outcomes across treatment arms and no
difference between Hispanic and non-Hispanic participants.
Tighe et al [57] explored psychological distress and impulsi vity
as secondary outcomes. The iBobbly app was associated with
a signif icant decrease in Kessler Psychological Distress Scale
scores after 6 weeks; however, there was no signif icant change
in impulsi vity [57]. Rushing et al [59] included the following
secondary outcomes: self-ef ficacy, self-esteem, resilience,
coping strate gies, substance use, and cultural identity . They
found that American Indian and Alaska Native participants who
reported better health on average at baseline were more likely
to report stronger cultural identity , cultural resilience, and
positi ve coping strate gies. No signif icant differences emer ged
in any of the primary outcomes of the BRA VE app (help
seeking, self-ef ficacy related to mental health, and negative
coping) [59,61]. A surprising finding for the BRA VE app was
that higher scores on help-seeking attitude at baseline were
associated with a decrease in the number of clicks or
engagement with the app. However, it is important to note thatWrobel et al [61] reported that the engagement data were highly
skewed, with some participants clicking an average of 3.4 times,
but some users click ed 49 times. Finally , Röhr et al [65] included
the secondary outcomes: self-ef ficacy, self-stigma, and
resilience. They found that after using the Sanadak app, Syrian
refugees showed no differences in any of the secondary
outcomes, except for self-stigma. Syrian refugees reported lower
levels of self-stigma following the use of the Sanadak app.
Quantitati ve evidence from mixed methods studies also showed
inconclusi ve results on both clinical and behavioral outcomes.
Neal-Barnett et al [63] concluded that Black and biracial girls
who used the BYOTS app reported signif icantly lower negative
and anxious thoughts on day 7 than on day 1. Although this
study showed a positi ve result, the app was used for only 1
week, so there is still uncertainty regarding whether these
impro vements would last. Watson-Singleton et al [67] reported
that Black African American participants who used Mindful
You showed a signif icant decrease in stress levels after 2 weeks.
They also showed increased capacity for emotional regulation
and a signif icant increase in self-ef ficacy and mindfulness
behaviors. However, there were no signif icant differences in
the endorsements of mindfulness attrib utes, attitudes, or
knowledge.
Finally , of the 2 qualitati ve studies, the one by Agapie et al [66]
used a focus group to ask about the percei ved effectiveness of
the different apps that the participants used. Hispanic and Latina
participants reported that all the apps used had small positi ve
impacts on their mental health. Miscellaneous apps were ranked
as the most effective in impro ving mental health well-being,
followed by CBT apps and mindfulness apps. Povey et al [64]
focused only on acceptability , whereas McCall et al [58]
explored usability rather than the effectiveness of the app.
Barriers to MHA Use Within Racial and Ethnic
Minority Groups
Several barriers to MHAs were reported by the studies, ranging
from cost to cultural appropriateness. Four studies did not
explicitly report any barriers; however, they did highlight that
not all clients may respond to self-guided treatment
[54,58,63,65].
One of the most common barriers to using MHAs was the lack
of personal touch. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, who
used the iBobbly app, reported the need for more cultural content
that related to their community [64]. This barrier was also true
for American Indian and Alaska Native participants who used
the BRA VE app [59]. Rushing et al [59] reported that due to
the lack of representation in the media, participants reacted
positi vely to both study arms, as they both contained cultural
content. Participants who used the iBobbly app reported that
such apps were not given enough community awareness and
were therefore less likely to be used [64]. Rushing et al [59]
also found that those with higher help-seeking tendencies were
less likely to use the BRA VE app, which they hypothesized
was because they were more likely to have support from people
around them. The need for a personal touch was common even
across the multiple apps explored by Agapie et al [66], with
Hispanic and Latina participants reporting that the content was
not specif ic enough for them.

RenderX The second most common barrier was stigma. Islander
participants who used the iBobbly app reported that others may
not engage with the app due to stigma surrounding mental health
[55]. Pratap et al [56] also noted similar concerns among
Hispanic participants when using the iPST app. Jamaican
participants have gone as far as to describe using MHAs as
embarrassing, relating to the stigma attached to recei ving mental
health support [62].
The third barrier was the cost. This was not so common but was
mentioned by both Islander and Hispanic participants [64,66].
Agapie et al [66] found that Hispanic participants were more
likely to use apps that were richer in free content compared with
those that required a subscription. Other barriers included the
repetiti veness of the MHA that was described by Rushing et al
[59] as “message fatigue, ” as lack of engagement was evident
after the 10th text sent by the BRA VE app. Furthermore, literac y
and language barriers were brought up by Islander participants
who argued that some people in their community may not be
comfortable using English [64]. Finally , technical issues were
also identif ied as barriers to using MHAs. For instance, Tighe
et al [55] failed to gather use data for 21 out of the 61
participants due to internet connecti vity issues, a technical
problem with their device, or an unchar ged battery . Stephens
et al [60] also noted that some participants lost access to their
mobile phones and were thus unable to interact with the content
of the BRA VE app.
Discussion
Principal Findings
This scoping review aimed to (1) describe the purposes of using
MHAs in racial and ethnic minority groups, (2) examine the
acceptability of MHAs among those groups, (3) examine the
effectiveness of MHAs with the groups, (4) identify the barriers
to MHA use within the groups, and (5) identify the gaps in the
literature. Overall, our research pooled findings from 15
publications and highlighted important findings regarding the
evidence related to MHA use among the racial and ethnic
minority groups. Overall, MHAs were used for different
purposes such as impro ving depression, decreasing
psychological distress, increasing cultural resilience, and
promoting help-seeking behavior. Fundamentally , most MHAs
targeting racial and ethnic minority groups are underpinned by
CBT and focus on depressi ve symptoms. In terms of
acceptability , MHAs appear to be of interest among racial and
ethnic minority groups; however, there is limited and mixed
evidence of their effectiveness. Barriers to use include
interv ention-specif ic characteristics (eg, repetiti veness of the
tasks), user-specif ic characteristics (eg, stigma), and
technology-specif ic characteristics (eg, internet connecti vity).
Finally , several gaps in the literature, namely , the participant
pool, MHAs design, study design, and study location, were
identif ied. Taken together , these findings need to be considered
to deepen our knowledge of MHA use and experiences among
racial and ethnic minority groups.
Regarding evidence based on the intended purpose of using
MHAs in racial and ethnic minority groups, most of the apps
included in our review focused on depression and psychologicaldistress. Although depression is one of the most common mental
health disorders with a high prevalence among young people
[68], the fact that it is one of the main purposes of the use of
MHAs in this population is relevant. For instance, people from
racial and ethnic minority backgrounds experience increased
challenges compared with the majority population including
social inequities, discrimination, and disparities in living
conditions and work environments that may increase the risk
of developing depression and psychological distress [26-28].
Islander participants who used the iBobbly app noted the need
of more cultural content that was specif ic for them to increase
engagement with the MHA [64]. However, Watson-Singleton
et al [67] reported a 45% dropout rate from Mindful You despite
having created a culturally specif ic app for Black African
American population. Thus, there seems to be uncertainty about
what specif ic changes would keep racial and ethnic minority
groups engaged in MHAs. Another common challenge
experienced by racial and ethnic minority groups is the stigma
against mental health, which can form a barrier to accessing
mental health support [33-35]. Stigma was a common barrier
to using MHAs across Islander , Hispanic, and Jamaican
participants [56,62,64]. Only one app in this review addressed
this issue and focused on impro ving help-seeking behaviors
[59]. However, the app reported no signif icant impro vement in
help-seeking behavior. In contrast, Röhr et al [65] found that a
secondary outcome of the Sanadak app was reduced self-stigma
in Syrian refugees. Therefore, future studies should aim to
impro ve help-seeking behaviors and reduce mental health stigma
in people from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds.
This review noted two critical observ ations regarding
acceptability: (1) the measurements used and (2) attitudes of
racial and ethnic minority groups toward MHAs. We followed
the definition by Sekhon et al [52] for measuring acceptability:
the willingness to participate and the adherence to the MHA.
In our review, 8 studies measured acceptability using use or
interacti ve data [54,56,57,59-61,64,67], and 7 used qualitati ve
methods such as intervie ws, workshops, and surveys
[40,55,58,62-64,66]. How acceptability is measured in these
studies is essential, as it can affect how an MHA is percei ved.
For instance, in our review, the iBobbly app was investig ated
using both use data [55] and qualitati ve methods [57]. The
findings showed that iBobbly was not acceptable in terms of
use data; however, qualitati ve evidence showed that Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islanders reported that the iBobbly app was
acceptable and culturally appropriate, and it reduced stigma
surrounding mental health issues. Our review further highlights
the heterogeneity in the definition and measurement of
acceptability , making it difficult to draw conclusions.
Second, there seems to be ambi valence around racial and ethnic
minority groups in terms of the acceptability of MHAs. Hispanic
and Latina participants showed a high willingness to use MHAs
[54,56] but showed a lack of engagement and high dropout rates
[54,56]. In contrast, Agapie et al [66] found that 60% of
Hispanic participants used the mindfulness apps even after the
trial. Similarly , this review shows how many among Black and
African American participants find MHAs useful and acceptable
[62,63,67]. However, in the study by Watson-Singleton et al
[67], almost half of the Black American participants dropped

RenderX out for no given reason. In the study by Malone y et al [62]
Jamaican participants explained stigma and embarrassment as
major barriers to use. Similarly , the BRA VE app was found to
be helpful for American Indian and Alaska Native participants;
however, upon closer examination of the interacti ve data,
Wrobel et al [61] found that engagement was lower than
expected. The study that used the iBobbly app showed that
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander participants were highly
willing to use MHAs [55]; however, there was still a lack of
interest in MHAs among them [55]. The other 2 racial and ethnic
minority groups included in this study were Syrian refugees
and Asian American individuals, who both showed high interest
in MHAs and high dropout rates [66] or would rather use
Facebook [40].
Overall, despite the high willingness of racial and ethnic
minority groups to use MHAs, evidence reports an overall mixed
view of engagement. More research adopting appropriate and
standardized methods for measuring acceptability should be
considered in the future.
Of note, 2 user-specif ic factors are related to the acceptability
of MHAs. First is the level of psychological distress among
racial and ethnic minority groups. In our review, we observ ed
that Indigenous Australians with higher levels of distress were
more likely to use MHAs and adhere to them [57]. However,
in qualitati ve studies, Indigenous Australians and Aboriginal
and Torres Strait Islanders reported that in extreme distress,
they might not benef it from MHAs and FTF therap y would be
more appropriate [55,64].
The second factor is help-seeking behavior as shown in the
BRA VE study . Stephens et al [60] and Wrobel et al [61] found
that surprisingly , those who scored high on help-seeking
behavior showed less engagement with the BRA VE app. It was
suggested that these participants might already have had their
own ways to deal with distress and, therefore, were less likely
to use other methods such as the BRA VE app. This corroborates
the findings of Lungu and Sun [40], who suggest that some
people from ethnic minority groups prefer to seek other forms
of support (eg, Facebook). Facebook is not a MHA; however,
some participants were more comfortable to reveal information
on Facebook than attend FTF therap y. It would be helpful to
understand the ways in which participants adapted to seek help,
as it seems to influence engagement.
Regarding the effectiveness of the apps, the review found only
2 quantitati vely effective apps: BYOTS and Mindful You
[63,67], which corroborates the findings from previous reviews
that reported limited or mixed evidence of the effectiveness of
MHAs [17,21,69]. Previous reviews revealed that most MHAs
claim effectiveness; however, there is no scientif ic evidence
supporting their claims. This highlights the dire need for
regulations on MHAs that are available on app stores. The
BYOTS and Mindful You apps were also trialed for only 1 and
2 weeks, respecti vely; therefore, we cannot confidently assume
that they will be effective for longer periods [63]. However, the
fact that these MHAs were effective in reducing negative and
anxious thoughts in Black and African Americans is in line with
previous literature that showed that when given access to
treatment, Black Americans benef it and engage more fromtherap y than White Americans [70]. Qualitati ve data found that
Aboriginal youth in the study by Tighe et al [55] reported
enjoying the iBobbly app even if it did not impro ve their clinical
symptoms. Similarly , the participants who used the BRA VE
app showed a signif icant positi ve impro vement, but it was not
different from those who recei ved science, technology ,
engineering, and mathematics (STEM) messages [59].
Moreo ver, Sanadak app, which was used by Röhr et al [65], did
not signif icantly decrease PTSD symptoms; however,
participants’ self-stigma toward mental health was notably
reduced. Overall, little is known about how users interact with
MHAs in clinically meaningful ways.
In terms of app-specif ic factors that affect effectiveness,
evidence shows that users prefer using mobile apps in short
bursts of time [19] highlighting that long-term use might result
in repetition for app users. A possible solution might be to have
users regularly engage with the app to impro ve its benef its [22].
Stephens et al [60] suggested creating a “pause” in the BRA VE
messages so that users continue to be engaged and avoid “text
fatigue. ” Future studies should investig ate the features that can
encourage engagement among MHAs users. This review
highlights the importance of co-design approaches and cultural
adaptations. Ramos et al [71] noted that culturally inspired
MHAs may be more appealing to racial and ethnic minority
groups and can lead to increased interv ention uptak e. All the
MHAs included in this study , except ¡Aptí vate! [54] and iPST
[56], were designed with the guidance of racial and ethnic
minority groups. The inclusion of these groups in the process
of creating the app prevents stereotyping and ensures the most
culturally relevant factors to the user [71]. ¡Aptí vate! [54] and
iPST [56] only included accessible language as a culturally
adapti ve factor in apps. This is in line with the review by Ramos
et al [71], who found that almost 58% of the MHAs included
only 1 criterion, suggesting that the inclusion of culturally
relevant criteria is far from the norm. Our review also showed
that a common barrier was that there was not enough cultural
content, even for apps specif ically designed for racial and ethnic
minority groups [64]. Future studies should consider the impact
of cultural factors on the effectiveness of MHAs. Furthermore,
future studies would benef it from exploring these factors from
a qualitati ve perspecti ve for more insights, as this review shows
only 1 effective MHA despite including many culturally
adapti ve factors.
Obser vations and Gaps in the Field With Suggestions
for Futur e Resear ch
Four important observ ations emer ged around the potential gaps
in the literature: participant pool, MHA design, study design,
and location of the study .
Participant Pool
The participants recruited in the studies that we reviewed were
primarily Hispanic and Latina or Black and biracial. Therefore,
there is a need to recruit participants in MHA research from a
wider racial and ethnic minority background. Another important
observ ation in the review is that only 2 studies [54,64] included
a greater number of unemplo yed than emplo yed participants.
The remaining studies included either emplo yed participants or
those who attended colle ges or schools. Future research should

XSL•FO
RenderX also include low-income racial and ethnic minority populations
to help find ways to effectively incorporate MHA technology
as an accessible mental health support tool.
MHA Design
Regarding the MHA design, the apps in this review were
primarily CBT based [54,64] or inspired by it using
acceptance-based therap y [55,57], problem-solving therap y
[56], cogniti ve musical restructuring [63], or a mixture of
psychotherap y and CBT [58,59,66]. Therefore, more research
is needed to explore different theoretical underpinnings to
identify what works for whom, in what conte xt, and among
different cultures.
Study Design
Most of the included studies were quantitati ve, which arguably
did not explain why the apps were ineffective. Strate gies such
as intervie ws or workshops might help better explore the barriers
experienced by participants and help tailor targeted
interv entions. For instance, studies with mixed methods design
offered valuable insights into the strengths and barriers of MHAs
[55,58,60,63]. Although qualitati ve research takes time, future
MHA research should consider qualitati ve research as the
benef icial next step to progress in the field of MHAs for racial
and ethnic minority populations.
Study Location
A total of 10 studies were conducted in the United States
[40,54,56,58-61,63,66,67], 2 in Australia [57,64], 1 in Canada
[55], 1 in the United Kingdom [62],1 in German y [65]. Overall,
more studies are needed globally to achie ve generalizability of
the findings and impro ve our understanding of MHA use among
people of racial and ethnic minorities. More research is needed
to explore whether MHA might be incorporated into existingservices as a source of additional support to help overcome
some of the existing barriers to service receipt among racial and
ethnic minority groups.
Limitations
This review benef ited from independent screening by 2
researchers, and this minimized selection bias. Similarly , 2
reviewers were involved in quality appraisal, thereby reducing
any bias in the assessments. However, this study has some
limitations. Although our search terms were guided by previous
systematic reviews including racial and ethnic minority groups,
this is not an extensi ve list of all terminology related to racial
and ethnic minority groups; therefore, the review was limited
to the search terms used. Moreo ver, as the researchers involved
could only read English, several studies that may have been
relevant to this review were excluded. However, despite not
imposing limitations on the country of origin and an extensi ve
list of racial and ethnic minority group–related search terms,
we were only able to include 15 studies; this demonstrates a
dearth of evidence of MHAs among racial and ethnic minority
groups, which highlights the need for further investig ation.
Conclusions
In this review, we aimed to explore the use of MHAs among
racial and ethnic minority groups. This review synthesized data
from 15 publications and reviewed 7 interv entions. Although
acceptability seems fairly consistent, more research is needed
to support MHA effectiveness and overcome existing barriers.
Overall, the literature on MHAs among racial and ethnic
minority groups is still scarce, and there is still much left to
understand. Future app developers should consider including
racial and ethnic minority groups’ input in the development of
MHAs as well as widening the scope of MHAs to focus on a
range of disorders and use different theoretical approaches.
